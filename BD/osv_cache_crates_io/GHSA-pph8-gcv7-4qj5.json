This could lead the Python interpreter to read beyond the end of the `&str` data and potentially leak contents of the out-of-bounds read (by raising a Python exception containing a copy of the data including the overflow).\n\nIn PyO3 0.24.1 this function will now allocate a `CString` to guarantee a terminating nul bytes. PyO3 0.25 will likely offer an alternative API which takes `&CStr` arguments.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pyo3","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/pyo3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.1.0"},{"fixed":"0.24.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-pph8-gcv7-4qj5/GHSA-pph8-gcv7-4qj5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/5005"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/5008"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0020.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-02T13:19:19Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
