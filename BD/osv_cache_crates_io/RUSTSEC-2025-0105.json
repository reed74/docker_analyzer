The issue has been confirmed using Miri.\n\nFixed in version 0.2.2 by using `resize_with` to properly initialize the buffer with `T::default()`, adding a `T: Default` bound to ensure sound initialization.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"direct_ring_buffer","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/direct_ring_buffer"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.2.2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["direct_ring_buffer::create_ring_buffer"],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-exposure"],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0105.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/direct_ring_buffer"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0105.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/ain1084/direct_ring_buffer/issues/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ain1084/direct_ring_buffer/pull/2"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"}}
