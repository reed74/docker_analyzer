This meant that `dicard_all_messages` could end up observing a non-null block pointer (and therefore attempting to free it) without setting `head.block` to null. This would then lead to `Channel::drop` making a second attempt at dropping the same pointer.\n\nThe bug was introduced while fixing a memory leak, in\nupstream [MR \\#1084](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1084),\nfirst published in 0.5.12.\n\nThe fix is in\nupstream [MR \\#1187](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187)\nand has been published in 0.5.15","affected":[{"package":{"name":"crossbeam-channel","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/crossbeam-channel"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.5.12-0"},{"fixed":"0.5.15"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption"],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0024.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/crossbeam-channel"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0024.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"}}
