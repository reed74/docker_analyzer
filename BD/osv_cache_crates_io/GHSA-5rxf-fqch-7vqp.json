The location of these stored responses is constructed from the URL of the request. Due to insufficient sanitation of the URL, it is possible for an attacker to craft a URL that results in the response being stored outside of the directory specified for it.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"routinator","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/routinator"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.9.0"},{"fixed":"0.12.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/09/GHSA-5rxf-fqch-7vqp/GHSA-5rxf-fqch-7vqp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39916"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/892"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/releases/tag/v0.12.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/routinator/CVE-2023-39916.txt"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-35"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-03T14:21:45Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-09-13T15:15:07Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
