The issue has been confirmed using Miri.\n\nFixed in version 0.2.2 by using `resize_with` to properly initialize the buffer with `T::default()`, adding a `T: Default` bound to ensure sound initialization.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"direct_ring_buffer","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/direct_ring_buffer"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-fp5x-7m4q-449f/GHSA-fp5x-7m4q-449f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ain1084/direct_ring_buffer/issues/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ain1084/direct_ring_buffer/pull/2"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ain1084/direct_ring_buffer"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0105.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-908"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-21T21:57:31Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
