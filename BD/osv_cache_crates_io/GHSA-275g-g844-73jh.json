Exploitation is unlikely, as no known clients currently use the API in this manner.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPassing only trusted (or sanitised) relation types to the `filter` argument of `EventCache::find_event_with_relations()` avoids the issue.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in matrix-sdk 0.13.\n\n### References\n\nThe issue was introduced in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4849.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"matrix-sdk","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/matrix-sdk"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.11.0"},{"fixed":"0.13.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-275g-g844-73jh/GHSA-275g-g844-73jh.json"}},{"package":{"name":"matrix-sdk-sqlite","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/matrix-sdk-sqlite"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.11.0"},{"fixed":"0.13.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-275g-g844-73jh/GHSA-275g-g844-73jh.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-275g-g844-73jh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53549"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4849"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/d0c01006e4808db5eb96ad5c496416f284d8bd3c"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0043.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-10T17:41:16Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-10T19:15:26Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
