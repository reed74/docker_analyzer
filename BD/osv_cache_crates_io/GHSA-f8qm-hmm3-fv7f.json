This may be used to significantly slow down operation of nodes.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in apps version 1.1.0. The transaction sections are now being checked for uniqueness and the number of permitted sections contained in a single transaction has been limited to 10,000.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds and users are advised to upgrade.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"namada-apps","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/namada-apps"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.1.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-f8qm-hmm3-fv7f/GHSA-f8qm-hmm3-fv7f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/anoma/namada/security/advisories/GHSA-f8qm-hmm3-fv7f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/anoma/namada"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-20T20:34:04Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H"}]}
