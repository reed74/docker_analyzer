The crate allows for any type to inhabit\nthe generic `K` and `V` type parameters and implements Send and Sync for them\nunconditionally.\n\nUsing a type that is not marked as `Send` or `Sync` with `Index` can allow it\nto be used across multiple threads leading to data races. Additionally using\nreference types for the keys or values will lead to the segmentation faults\nin the crate's code.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"appendix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/appendix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption","thread-safety"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2020-0149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/appendix"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0149.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/krl/appendix/issues/6"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
