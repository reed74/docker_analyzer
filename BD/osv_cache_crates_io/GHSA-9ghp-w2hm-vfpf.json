Otherwise, the function could dump the memory into file illegally, causing memory leak.\n\n> **Note**: this is an internal-only crate in the Wasmtime project not intended for external use and is more strongly signaled nowadays as of [bytecodealliance/wasmtime#10963](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10963).
