For example, elements of type `&&str`\ncould end up in a slice of type `[&str]`, since `&&str` coerces to `&str` via a\nderef coercion.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by implementing typechecking for distributed slice\nelements in such a way that coercion no longer occurs. The element's type must\nbe a subtype of the slice's declared element type.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linkme","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/linkme"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.3.24"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0407.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/linkme"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0407.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/dtolnay/linkme/issues/82"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"}}
