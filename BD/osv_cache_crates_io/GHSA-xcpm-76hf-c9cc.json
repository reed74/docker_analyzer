According to Rust's documentation, `from_raw_parts` requires all bytes to be properly initialized, but padding bytes in structs are not guaranteed to be initialized. This violates the safety contract and causes undefined behavior.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"borrowck_sacrifices","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/borrowck_sacrifices"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-xcpm-76hf-c9cc/GHSA-xcpm-76hf-c9cc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/alexpyattaev/borrowck_sacrifices/issues/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/alexpyattaev/borrowck_sacrifices/commit/1bdaa14da68a6e8207f9e81359116f53139800f2"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/alexpyattaev/borrowck_sacrifices"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0107.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-824"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-22T16:35:08Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
