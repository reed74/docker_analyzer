According to Rust's safety rules, creating such a pointer causes immediate undefined behavior.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"orx-pinned-vec","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/orx-pinned-vec"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"3.21.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["orx_pinned_vec::utils::slice::index_of_ptr"],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption"],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0106.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/orx-pinned-vec"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0106.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/orxfun/orx-pinned-vec/issues/52"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/orxfun/orx-pinned-vec/pull/53"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"}}
