The lib/writer.js file contains obfuscated code that collects and exfiltrates data. It collects sensitive information: environment variables, OS platform, hostname, username, and MAC addresses. Sends this information via a POST request to `https://log-server-lovat.vercel.app/api/ipcheck/703`. The most dangerous part is `eval(r.data)`. This is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. The server can send back any JavaScript code, and it will be executed on the user's machine","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-mongoose-orm","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/node-mongoose-orm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/npm/node-mongoose-orm/MAL-2025-5829.json"}}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":null},"credits":[{"name":"SafeDep","contact":["https://safedep.io"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
