Taffy sets an internal index for each data item in its DB. However, it is found that the internal index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is found in the query, TaffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access any data items in the DB. **Note:** `taffy` and its successor package `taffydb` are not maintained.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"taffy","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/taffy"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.6.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/02/GHSA-mxhp-79qh-mcx6/GHSA-mxhp-79qh-mcx6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"taffydb","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/taffydb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.7.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/02/GHSA-mxhp-79qh-mcx6/GHSA-mxhp-79qh-mcx6.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10790"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFY-546521"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/taffy"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/taffydb"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-668"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2020-02-18T20:15:03Z","nvd_published_at":"2020-02-17T20:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
