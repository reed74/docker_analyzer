This flaw allows an attacker to construct a malicious callbackURL that passes origin checks and triggers an open redirect.\n\nBecause redirect endpoints include sensitive tokens (such as password-reset tokens), this vulnerability can enable one-click account takeover if a victim clicks a crafted link.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"better-auth","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/better-auth"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.21"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.1.20","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-vp58-j275-797x/GHSA-vp58-j275-797x.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-vp58-j275-797x"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/b381cac7aafd6aa53ef78b6ab771ebfa24643c80"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/ddebd0358d74376ea64541512d0167dd4377f182/packages/better-auth/src/api/middlewares/origin-check.ts#L53"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-24T20:49:50Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
