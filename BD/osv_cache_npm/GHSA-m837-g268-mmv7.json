This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. \n\nThis allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username.\n\nTo conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).\n\nIn fixing this we upgraded xml-crypto to v6.1.2 and made sure to process the SAML assertions from only verified/authenticated contents. This will prevent future variants from coming up.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-saml","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/node-saml"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3.1.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-m837-g268-mmv7/GHSA-m837-g268-mmv7.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@node-saml/node-saml","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40node-saml/node-saml"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 5.0.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-m837-g268-mmv7/GHSA-m837-g268-mmv7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-m837-g268-mmv7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54369"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/commit/31ead9411ebc3e2385086fa9149b6c17732bca10"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/releases/tag/v5.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-347","CWE-87"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-25T14:08:50Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-24T23:15:26Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
