The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe feature has been implemented in Parse Server 4.2.0 but never worked and reliably crashes the server when trying to use it due to a bug in its implementation. Since the feature is not currently working, and due to its risky nature, it has been removed to address the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"parse-server","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/parse-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"4.2.0"},{"fixed":"7.5.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-x4qj-2f4q-r4rx/GHSA-x4qj-2f4q-r4rx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"parse-server","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/parse-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.4.0-alpha.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 8.4.0-alpha.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-x4qj-2f4q-r4rx/GHSA-x4qj-2f4q-r4rx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-x4qj-2f4q-r4rx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64430"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9903"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9904"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/8bbe3efbcf4a3b66f4a8db9bfb18cd98c050db51"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/97763863b72689a29ad7a311dfb590c3e3c50585"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-05T19:52:27Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-07T18:15:37Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
