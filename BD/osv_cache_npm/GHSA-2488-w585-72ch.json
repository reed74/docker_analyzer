The affected versions prior to 0.18.6 allow attackers to manipulate the library's translation functionality by supplying maliciously crafted keys containing prototype chain elements (e.g., __proto__ ), leading to prototype pollution. This weakness enables adversaries to inject arbitrary properties into the JavaScript Object prototype through the first parameter of the translate method when combined with specific separator configurations, potentially resulting in denial-of-service conditions or remote code execution in vulnerable applications. The issue arises from the library's failure to properly validate or neutralize special characters in translation key inputs before processing.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"counterpart","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/counterpart"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.18.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-2488-w585-72ch/GHSA-2488-w585-72ch.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-57354"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/martinandert/counterpart/issues/54"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/VulnSageAgent/PoCs/tree/main/JavaScript/prototype-pollution/CVE-2025-57354"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/martinandert/counterpart"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-26T16:58:56Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-24T18:15:41Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
