If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation.\n\n### PoC\n1. Set `LOG_LEVEL=\"raw\"` in the environment.\n2. Send a request with the `access_token` in the query string.\n3. Notice that the `access_token` in `req.query` is not redacted.\n\n### Impact\nIt impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@directus/api","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40directus/api"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"21.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-vw58-ph65-6rxp/GHSA-vw58-ph65-6rxp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-vw58-ph65-6rxp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47822"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2e893f9c576d5a02506272fe2c0bcc12e6c58768"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-14T15:20:40Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-10-08T18:15:31Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
