The hook trusts raw multi-session cookies and forwards the extracted values directly to internalAdapter.deleteSessions without verifying the cookie signature. Because cookie values are not validated with getSignedCookie (or any equivalent check), an attacker can supply a forged _multi-* cookie to trigger deletion of arbitrary session tokens.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"better-auth","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/better-auth"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.3.34"},{"fixed":"1.4.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-wmjr-v86c-m9jj/GHSA-wmjr-v86c-m9jj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-wmjr-v86c-m9jj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/cfc453a2a6eb02951f9a0a7c944064936e73eee8"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/releases/tag/v1.4.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-345"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-26T22:11:50Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
