Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are unimpacted.\n\nSpecifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `30.0.5`\n* `31.0.0-beta.1`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"electron","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/electron"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"30.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"30.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-xw5q-g62x-2qjc/GHSA-xw5q-g62x-2qjc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"electron","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/electron"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"31.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"31.0.0-beta.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-xw5q-g62x-2qjc/GHSA-xw5q-g62x-2qjc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-xw5q-g62x-2qjc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46992"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/electron/electron"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-354"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-30T17:54:11Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-01T02:15:20Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
