The application does not verify the actor’s authority to perform that credential change (no current-password check, no authorization enforcement). An attacker who is merely authenticated (or who can trick or coerce an authenticated session) can set a new password and gain control of the account. (ATO - Account Takeover)\n\n### Details\nOccurence - code:\nhttps://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/packages/ui/src/views/account/index.jsx#L278 \n\nRemote and physical scenarios can be considered.\n\n### PoC\n**Repro steps:**\n1. As logged in user https://cloud.flowiseai.com/account scroll down to 'Security' section\n2. Change password to the new password\n3. Notice Unverified Password Change (authenticated change without current password)\n\n**POC:** \nPassword changed, and notice \"Password updated\" message.\n\n**Screenshot:**\n<img width=\"467\" height=\"526\" alt=\"secpw\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cc52978-9f37-42ca-a2b2-7285c4da9f1c\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nFull account takeover (ATO) of affected accounts (loss of confidentiality and integrity of account data).\nUser account recovery mechanisms (password reset flows tied to email) can be bypassed or abused if combined with this issue and the second one which I've reported (similar security issue with the email - part of credentials).
