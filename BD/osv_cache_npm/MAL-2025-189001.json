These packages typically contain autopublish scripts (auto.js, autopublish.js, autopublish2.js, autopublish3.js) designed to automatically generate and publish derivative packages with randomized names to inflate developer reputation scores for tea protocol token rewards. The malicious payload modifies package.json to remove private flags, changes version numbers, generates random Indonesian-themed package names (some variants are also in English), and continuously republishes variants to pollute the npm registry.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"quantum-darkmatter-native-schema","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/quantum-darkmatter-native-schema"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/npm/quantum-darkmatter-native-schema/MAL-2025-189001.json"}}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2025-11-13T03:32:30.226605749Z","modified_time":"2025-11-13T03:23:14Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"SEMVER"}],"sha256":"df4b7d2e949c0c56d06fd440de24261c533ae34fa972d0a9fb8cd3cce716c207","source":"amazon-inspector"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Amazon Inspector","contact":["actran@amazon.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
