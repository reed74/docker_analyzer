If the attacker set up a server with an invalid certificate, and they can force the application to call the webhook repeatedly, then they can cause a memory leak. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/4088.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf a webhook fails, avoid keep calling it repeatedly.\n\n### References\n\nReported as: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/3895","affected":[{"package":{"name":"undici","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/undici"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.29.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3.json"}},{"package":{"name":"undici","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/undici"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.21.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3.json"}},{"package":{"name":"undici","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/undici"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.5.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47279"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/3895"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/4088"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-401"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-15T14:15:06Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-15T18:15:38Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
