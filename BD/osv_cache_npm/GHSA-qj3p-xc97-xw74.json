The injected code attempts to interfere with dApp-to-wallet communication when executed in a browser context. \n\nWhile MetaMask SDK itself was not directly impacted, projects installing the SDK during this window may have inadvertently pulled in the malicious version of `debug`.\n\n### Mitigation\n- If your application was rebuilt and redeployed after Sept 8th, 2025, 15:30 UTC, the malicious version of debug should no longer be present. Please also verify that your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.) is not caching `debug@4.4.2`.\n- If you have not yet deployed since performing one of the actions above, delete your `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies before deploying.\n- If your application was deployed during the attack window and has not been rebuilt since, perform a clean install of dependencies and redeploy to ensure the malicious package is removed.\n\n### Resources\n[GitHub Advisory for debug](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8mgj-vmr8-frr6)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@metamask/sdk","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40metamask/sdk"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.16.0"},{"fixed":"0.33.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.33.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@metamask/sdk-react","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40metamask/sdk-react"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.16.0"},{"fixed":"0.33.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.33.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@metamask/sdk-communication-layer","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40metamask/sdk-communication-layer"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.16.0"},{"fixed":"0.33.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.33.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-qj3p-xc97-xw74"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk/pull/1342"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk/commit/baa185c6cfa97755a3d389d956372ad9eb37c4a4"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-506"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-15T13:55:56Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"}}
