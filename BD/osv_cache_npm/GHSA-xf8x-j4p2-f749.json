Create a new minimal Astro project (`astro@5.13.0`).\n\n2. Configure it to use the Node adapter (`@astrojs/node@9.1.0` — newer versions are not impacted):\n\n   ```js\n   // astro.config.mjs\n   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n   import node from '@astrojs/node';\n\n   export default defineConfig({\n   \tadapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. Build the site by running `astro build`.\n\n4. Run the server, e.g. with `astro preview`.\n\n5. Append `/_image?href=//placehold.co/600x400` to the preview URL, e.g. <http://localhost:4321/_image?href=//placehold.co/600x400>\n\n6. The site will serve the image from the unauthorized `placehold.co` origin.\n\n### Impact\n\nAllows a non-authorized third-party to create URLs on an impacted site’s origin that serve unauthorized image content.\nIn the case of SVG images, this could include the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) if a user followed a link to a maliciously crafted SVG.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"astro","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/astro"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"5.13.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@astrojs/node","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40astrojs/node"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.1.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 9.1.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749.json"}},{"package":{"name":"astro","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/astro"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.16.19"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 4.16.18","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/withastro/astro/security/advisories/GHSA-xf8x-j4p2-f749"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55303"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/4d16de7f95db5d1ec1ce88610d2a95e606e83820"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/withastro/astro"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-19T15:40:31Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-19T19:15:36Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N"}]}
