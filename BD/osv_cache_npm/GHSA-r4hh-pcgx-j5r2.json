An authenticated attacker able to create or run a tool that leverages Puppeteer/Playwright can specify attacker-controlled browser binary paths and parameters. When the tool executes, the attacker-controlled executable/parameters are run on the host and circumvent the intended nodevm sandbox restrictions, resulting in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the host.\n\n**NOTE**: This vulnerability was incorrectly assigned as a duplicate CVE-2025-26319 and should be considered distinct from that identifier.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"flowise","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/flowise"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.1"},{"fixed":"3.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-r4hh-pcgx-j5r2/GHSA-r4hh-pcgx-j5r2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/security/advisories/GHSA-5w3r-f6gm-c25w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34267"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/pull/5231"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://flowiseai.com"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/flowise-auth-command-execution-and-sandbox-bypass-via-puppeteer-and-playwright-packages"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-14T22:17:23Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-14T20:15:34Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:L/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L"}]}
