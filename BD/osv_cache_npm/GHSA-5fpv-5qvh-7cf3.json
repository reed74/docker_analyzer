Additionally, the application has default private keys for JWTs. Users aren't prompted to change credentials or secrets during installation, and there is no way to change them through the UI.\n\n### Affected Resources\n\n- [HAXCMS.js](https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/blob/main/src/lib/HAXCMS.js#L1614) HAXCMSClass\n\n### Impact\n\nAn unauthenticated attacker can read the default user credentials and JWT private keys from the public haxtheweb GitHub repositories. These credentials and keys can be used to access unconfigured self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites, and perform further attacks.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11.0.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-5fpv-5qvh-7cf3/GHSA-5fpv-5qvh-7cf3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-5fpv-5qvh-7cf3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54137"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/commit/6dc2441c876350ca6fe9fbaecb058d92ef442869"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/blob/main/src/lib/HAXCMS.js#L1614"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1392"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-21T19:53:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-22T22:15:38Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
