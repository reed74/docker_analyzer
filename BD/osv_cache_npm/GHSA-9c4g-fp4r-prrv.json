It trusts branch names as they are (plain text)\n2. It spawns git commands by concatenating user input\n\nSince a branch name is potentially a user input - as users can create branches remotely via pull requests, or simply due to privileged access to a repository - it can effectively be abused to run any command.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"check-branches","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/check-branches"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.0.19"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-9c4g-fp4r-prrv/GHSA-9c4g-fp4r-prrv.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11148"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/lirantal/054b4ad039a86c418f2c84e3e884d6ec"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/puntorigen/check-branches"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CHECKBRANCHES-2766494"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77","CWE-78"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-30T21:08:04Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-30T11:37:38Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
