You can even go deeper to see sensitive data; `/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd`\n\n### Impact and solution\nIf `staticFiles` is set under `serve` in the configuration file. you have two options to fix vulnerability;\n\n- Update `@graphql-mesh/cli` to a version higher than `0.82.21`, and if you use `@graphql-mesh/http`, update it to a version higher than `0.3.18`\n- Remove `staticFiles` option from the configuration, and use other solutions to serve static files.\n\n### Credits\nThanks [alanwillms@gmail.com](mailto:alanwillms@gmail.com) for reporting this vulnerability with details","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@graphql-mesh/cli","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40graphql-mesh/cli"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.78.0"},{"fixed":"0.82.22"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/02/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@graphql-mesh/http","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40graphql-mesh/http"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.3.19"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/02/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27098"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/commit/95d93e7c140c2995b37e9d822aa3fe4e24ed2e78"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-02-16T18:41:07Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-02-20T21:15:26Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
