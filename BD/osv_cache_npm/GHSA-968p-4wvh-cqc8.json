It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@babel/helpers","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/helpers"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.26.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/runtime","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.26.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/runtime-corejs2","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime-corejs2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.26.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/runtime-corejs3","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime-corejs3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.26.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/helpers","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/helpers"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.0-alpha.17"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"< 8.0.0-alpha.16","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/runtime","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.0-alpha.17"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"< 8.0.0-alpha.16","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/runtime-corejs2","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime-corejs2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.0-alpha.17"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"< 8.0.0-alpha.16","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@babel/runtime-corejs3","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40babel/runtime-corejs3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.0-alpha.17"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"< 8.0.0-alpha.16","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27789"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/d5952e80c0faa5ec20e35085531b6e572d31dad4"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/babel/babel"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-11T20:30:18Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-11T20:15:18Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
