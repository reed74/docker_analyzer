Parse Server permits any client to execute explain queries without requiring the master key. This exposes:\n\n- Database schema structure and field names\n- Index configurations and query optimization details\n- Query execution statistics and performance metrics\n- Potential attack vectors for database performance exploitation\n\n### Patches\n\nA new `databaseOptions.allowPublicExplain` configuration option has been introduced that allows to restrict `explain` queries to the master key. The option defaults to `true` for now to avoid a breaking change in production systems that depends on public `explain` availability. In addition, a security warning is logged when the option is not explicitly set, or set to `true`. In a future major release of Parse Server, the default will change to `false`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nImplementing middleware to block explain queries from non-master-key requests, or monitor and alert on explain query usage in production environments.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"parse-server","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/parse-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.5.0-alpha.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-7cx5-254x-cgrq/GHSA-7cx5-254x-cgrq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7cx5-254x-cgrq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64502"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9890"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/4456b02280c2d8dd58b7250e9e67f1a8647b3452"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-201"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-13T00:09:41Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-10T22:15:37Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
