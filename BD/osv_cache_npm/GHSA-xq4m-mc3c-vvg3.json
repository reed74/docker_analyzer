Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to [RyotaK](hxxps://ryotak.net) from [GMO Flatt Security Inc.](hxxps://flatt.tech/en/) for reporting this issue!","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@anthropic-ai/claude-code","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40anthropic-ai/claude-code"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.93"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-xq4m-mc3c-vvg3/GHSA-xq4m-mc3c-vvg3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/security/advisories/GHSA-xq4m-mc3c-vvg3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66032"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-03T16:27:19Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-03T19:15:57Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
