Verification of Data Authenticity","details":"### Impact\n\nApplications that use the `verifyWebhook()` helper to verify incoming Clerk webhooks are susceptible to accepting improperly signed webhook events.\n\n### Patches\n\n* `@clerk/backend`: the helper has been patched as of `2.4.0`\n* `@clerk/astro`: the helper has been patched as of `2.10.2`\n* `@clerk/express`: the helper has been patched

`1.7.5`\n* `@clerk/react-router`: the helper has been patched as of `1.6.4`\n* `@clerk/remix`: the helper has been patched as of `4.8.5`\n* `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`: the helper has been patched as of `0.18.3`\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe issue was resolved in **`@clerk/backend` `2.4.0`** by:\n\n* Properly parsing the webhook request's signatures and comparing them against the signature generated
