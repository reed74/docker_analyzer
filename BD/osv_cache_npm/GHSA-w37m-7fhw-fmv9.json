The issue is tracked upstream as [CVE-2025-55183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55183).\n\nA malicious HTTP request can be crafted and sent to any App Router endpoint that can return the compiled source code of [Server Functions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions). This could reveal business logic, but would not expose secrets unless they were hardcoded directly into [Server Function](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions) code.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.0.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.0.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.1.1-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.1.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.2.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.2.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.3.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.3.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.4.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.4.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.5.1-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.5.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.6.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.6.0-canary.59"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"16.0.0-beta.0"},{"fixed":"16.0.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"16.1.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"16.1.0-canary.17"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-w37m-7fhw-fmv9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nextjs.org/blog/security-update-2025-12-11"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55183"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1395","CWE-497","CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-11T22:49:56Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
