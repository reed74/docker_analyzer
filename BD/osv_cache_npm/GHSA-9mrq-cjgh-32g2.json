It may allow hostile 3rd parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner.\n\n### Patches\n`rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you can not upgrade to `v1.14.1`:\n1. Ensure _View_ link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams\n2. If _View_ link is going to a 3rd party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"` links.\n\n    Following combination of smartbanner meta tags can be used to achieve the above:\n\n    ```html\n    <meta name=\"smartbanner:enabled-platforms\" content=\"none\">\n    <meta name=\"smartbanner:include-user-agent-regex\" content=\"Mobile.*Safari\">\n    ```\n\n### References\n* [About rel=noopener](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/)\n* [Safari 12.1 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari_release_notes/safari_12_1_release_notes#3130296)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [smartbanner.js](https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/issues/new)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"smartbanner.js","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/smartbanner.js"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.14.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2019/09/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/commit/fce8c31dfe04033d9d005a89694d3e7a60784f89"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601","CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2020-06-16T21:29:02Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:U"}]}
