This can be abused to poison the router’s base path, causing all routes to return 404 for all users.\n\nThis issue is only exploitable when `baseURL` is not explicitly configured (e.g., `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is missing) *and* the attacker is able to make the very first request to the server after startup. In properly configured environments or typical managed hosting platforms, this fallback behavior cannot be reached.\n\n# Details\n\nA combination of `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` is implicitly trusted. This allows the first request to configure baseURL whenever it is not explicitly configured.\n\nHere's the code that reads the headers:\n\n<img width=\"631\" height=\"219\" alt=\"headers\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3fb0078-a62f-4058-9d0b-4afbd30c4953\" />\n\nHere's the call to `getBaseURL()`, the result is assigned to `ctx.baseURL`.\n\n<img width=\"838\" height=\"414\" alt=\"write\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b4dd17-75c3-49ef-9d08-6a2079d6a0ea\" />\n\nHere's the router receiving the poisoned `basePath`:\n\n<img width=\"594\" height=\"372\" alt=\"router\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fdf2862-9cd1-4b96-b146-18e67d904157\" />\n\n`X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` can be used to modify the pathname of a parsed URL object which forms `baseURL`. `basePath` is then derived from the pathname of `baseURL`. Once the router `basePath` is poisoned it fails to match & route incoming requests.\n\n# Repro\n\nStart a better-auth server with no `baseURL` configuration.\n\nSend the following request as the first request to the server:\n\n```curl\ncurl -i --location 'https://example.com/api/auth/ok' \\\n--header 'X-Forwarded-Proto: some:' \\\n--header 'X-Forwarded-Host: junk'\n```\n\nThe better-auth API check endpoint returns 404.\n\nNow send a regular request without the `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers.\n\n```curl\ncurl -i --location 'https://example.com/api/auth/ok'\n```\n\nThe better-auth API check endpoint still returns 404.\n\n_Example result_\n\n<img width=\"662\" height=\"307\" alt=\"attack\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9cfdb5-3db7-4504-9f0a-b3c32a6dc823\" />\n\nWe have modified the `basePath` for the router until the server is restarted. An attacker can repeatedly send these attack requests aiming to persistently exploit the vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"better-auth","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/better-auth"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-569q-mpph-wgww/GHSA-569q-mpph-wgww.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-569q-mpph-wgww"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/70e7c72780bdec075dba6cad1afe0832772bfe09"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/releases/tag/v1.4.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-73"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-01T21:29:48Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
