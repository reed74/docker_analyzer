Since `Vary` is a response header that should only be managed by the server, this could allow an attacker to influence caching behavior or cause inconsistent CORS handling.\n\nMost environments will see impact only when shared caches or proxies rely on the `Vary` header. The practical effect varies by configuration.\n\n### Impact  \nMay cause cache key pollution and inconsistent CORS enforcement in certain setups. No direct confidentiality, integrity, or availability impact in default configurations.  \n\n### Resolution  \nUpdate to the latest patched release. The CORS middleware has been corrected to handle `Vary` exclusively as a response header.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hono","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/hono"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-q7jf-gf43-6x6p/GHSA-q7jf-gf43-6x6p.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-q7jf-gf43-6x6p"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/d9b8b4b73b4f997994f2764013207365fe711282"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-444"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-24T19:15:13Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
