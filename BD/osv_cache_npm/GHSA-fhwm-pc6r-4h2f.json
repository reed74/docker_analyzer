When a message command is invoked using an alias, the `ctx.commandName` value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This occurs in both middleware functions and within the command’s own run function.\n\nAlthough not explicitly documented, CommandKit’s examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly convey that `ctx.commandName` represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples in the documentation consistently use `ctx.commandName` to reference the command being executed, and the documentation describes middleware as suitable for “logging, authentication, permission checks, or any other cross-cutting concerns.” As a result, developers reasonably expect `ctx.commandName` to return the canonical command name and may rely on it for security-sensitive logic.\n\nDevelopers who assume `ctx.commandName` is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands and context menu commands are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in v1.2.0-rc.12.\n`ctx.commandName` now consistently returns the actual canonical command name, regardless of the alias used to invoke it.\n\n### Workaround\n\nIf upgrading isn't immediately possible:\n\n* Use `ctx.command.data.command.name` for permission validations, or\n* Include all command aliases in your permission logic.\n\n### References\n\n* [CommandKit repository](https://github.com/underctrl-io/commandkit)\n* [Middleware documentation](https://commandkit.dev/docs/guide/commands/middlewares)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"commandkit","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/commandkit"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.2.0-rc.1"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-rc.12"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.2.0-rc.11","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-fhwm-pc6r-4h2f/GHSA-fhwm-pc6r-4h2f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/underctrl-io/commandkit/security/advisories/GHSA-fhwm-pc6r-4h2f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62378"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/underctrl-io/commandkit/commit/440385a3e5de3fa3d2a76d23a807995cb29602fd"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/underctrl-io/commandkit"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-706"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-13T17:43:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-15T17:16:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
