User-controlled input is reflected into the HTTP response without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser of a logged-in user who views the affected page/route. The attack can be triggered over the network with low complexity and requires a low-privileged authenticated context and user interaction (viewing the page). Impact is limited to confidentiality and integrity of the session in the affected UI.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"express-gateway","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/express-gateway"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.16.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-q4rg-7cjj-5r86/GHSA-q4rg-7cjj-5r86.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9095"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/freshfish-hust/my-cves/issues/5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/freshfish-hust/my-cves/issues/5#issue-3286622393"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.320417"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://vuldb.com/?id.320417"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://vuldb.com/?submit.627709"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-19T16:10:18Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-17T23:15:28Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
