The problem would only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages.\n\nSee https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/issues/142 for the original report.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched by https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/pull/143. It is available in version 2.3.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe problem can be fixed outside of Orejime by sanitizing attributes which could contain executable code.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"orejime","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/orejime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-72mh-hgpm-6384/GHSA-72mh-hgpm-6384.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/security/advisories/GHSA-72mh-hgpm-6384"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68457"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/issues/142"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/pull/143"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-19T19:17:26Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-19T17:15:53Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:U"}]}
