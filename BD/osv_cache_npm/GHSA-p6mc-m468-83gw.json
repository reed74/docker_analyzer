The functions `pick`, `set`, `setWith`, `update`, `updateWith`, and `zipObjectDeep` allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers are user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires manipulating objects based on user-provided property values or arrays.\n\nThis vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead to Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lodash","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.7.0"},{"fixed":"4.17.19"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash-es","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash-es"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.7.0"},{"fixed":"4.17.20"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash.pick","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash.pick"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"last_affected":"4.4.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash.set","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash.set"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.7.0"},{"last_affected":"4.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash.setwith","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash.setwith"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash.update","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash.update"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.10.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash.updatewith","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/lodash.updatewith"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.10.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lodash-rails","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/lodash-rails"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.7.0"},{"fixed":"4.17.19"}]}],"versions":["3.10.0","3.10.1","3.7.0","3.9.3","4.0.0","4.11.2","4.12.0","4.13.1","4.14.1","4.15.0","4.16.1","4.16.3","4.16.4","4.16.6","4.17.10","4.17.11","4.17.14","4.17.15","4.17.2","4.17.4","4.17.5","4.3.0","4.5.1","4.6.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/07/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw/GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8203"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/4744"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/4874"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2884"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/c84fe82760fb2d3e03a63379b297a1cc1a2fce12"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/712065"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/864701"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/lodash/lodash"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v41719"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/lodash-rails/CVE-2020-8203.yml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0006"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210914001339/https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/4744"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321","CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2020-07-15T19:14:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2020-07-15T17:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
