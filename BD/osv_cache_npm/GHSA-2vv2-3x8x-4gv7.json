However, Flowise's inherent authentication and authorization model is minimal and lacks role-based access controls (RBAC). Furthermore, in Flowise versions before 3.0.1 the default installation operates without authentication unless explicitly configured. This combination allows unauthenticated network attackers to execute unsandboxed OS commands.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"flowise","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/flowise"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-2vv2-3x8x-4gv7/GHSA-2vv2-3x8x-4gv7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8943"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/flowise-os-command-remote-code-execution-jfsa-2025-001380578"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-306","CWE-78"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-14T17:27:25Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-14T10:15:29Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
