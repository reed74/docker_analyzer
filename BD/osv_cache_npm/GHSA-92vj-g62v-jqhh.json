According to the HTTP specification, `Content-Length` must be ignored in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured limit.\n\nMost standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests with `400 Bad Request`, so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment.\n\n### Impact\nIf body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests, this flaw could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests.\n\n### Resolution\nThe implementation has been updated to align with the HTTP specification, ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7, and all users should upgrade immediately.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hono","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/hono"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-92vj-g62v-jqhh/GHSA-92vj-g62v-jqhh.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-92vj-g62v-jqhh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59139"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/605c70560b52f13af10379f79b76717042fafe8d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-12T21:12:20Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-12T14:15:41Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
