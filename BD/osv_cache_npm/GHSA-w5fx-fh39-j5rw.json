Users running 0.38.0 or earlier should update immediately via their package manager or by reinstalling the latest Codex CLI to ensure sandbox boundaries are enforced.\n\nIf using the Codex IDE extension, users should immediately update to **0.4.12** for a fix of the sandbox issue.\n\nThank you to Tzanko Matev (Codetracer) for reporting the issue!","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@openai/codex","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40openai/codex"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.2.0"},{"fixed":"0.39.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.38.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-w5fx-fh39-j5rw/GHSA-w5fx-fh39-j5rw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openai/codex/security/advisories/GHSA-w5fx-fh39-j5rw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59532"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openai/codex/commit/8595237505a1e0faabc2af3db805b66ce3ae182d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/openai/codex"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.39.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-19T17:14:04Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-22T21:16:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
