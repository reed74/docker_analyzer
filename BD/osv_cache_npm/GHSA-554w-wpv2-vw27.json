This leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) via stack exhaustion when parsing untrusted DER inputs.\n\n### Details\n\nAn ASN.1 Denial of Service (Dos) vulnerability exists in the node-forge `asn1.fromDer` function within `forge/lib/asn1.js`. The ASN.1 DER parser implementation (`_fromDer`) recurses for every constructed ASN.1 value (SEQUENCE, SET, etc.) and lacks a guard limiting recursion depth. An attacker can craft a small DER blob containing a very large nesting depth of constructed TLVs which causes the Node.js V8 engine to exhaust its call stack and throw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, crashing or incapacitating the process handling the parse. This is a remote, low-cost Denial-of-Service against applications that parse untrusted ASN.1 objects.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to reliably crash a server or client using node-forge for TLS connections or certificate parsing.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the ans1.fromDer function in `node-forge` before patched version `1.3.2`. \n\nAny downstream application using this component is impacted. These components may be leveraged by downstream applications in ways that enable full compromise of availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-forge","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/node-forge"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-554w-wpv2-vw27/GHSA-554w-wpv2-vw27.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-554w-wpv2-vw27"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/260425c6167a38aae038697132483b5517b26451"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-674"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-26T22:08:37Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
