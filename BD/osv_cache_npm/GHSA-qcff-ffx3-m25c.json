The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `clone` command is vulnerable through the branch name.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"meta-git","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/meta-git"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/09/GHSA-qcff-ffx3-m25c/GHSA-qcff-ffx3-m25c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/728040"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1457"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2020-08-31T18:59:58Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"}}
