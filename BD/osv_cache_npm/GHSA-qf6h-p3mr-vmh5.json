This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nDirectus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated external attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the client. This is possible because the application injects an attacker-controlled parameter that will be stored in the server and used by the client into an unsanitized DOM element. When chained with CVE-2024-6534, it could result in account takeover.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"directus","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/directus"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"10.13.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-qf6h-p3mr-vmh5/GHSA-qf6h-p3mr-vmh5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6533"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://directus.io"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/bocelli"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-08-15T21:55:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-08-15T03:15:04Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
