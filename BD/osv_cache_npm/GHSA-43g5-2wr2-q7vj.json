This requires user interaction in the form of the user using ‘tab’ to autocomplete text that is a prefix of the attacker’s prepared autocompletion. This issue affects mongosh versions prior to 2.3.9. \n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mongosh","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/mongosh"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-43g5-2wr2-q7vj/GHSA-43g5-2wr2-q7vj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1691"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongosh"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOSH-2024"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-27T17:15:42Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-02-27T13:15:11Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
