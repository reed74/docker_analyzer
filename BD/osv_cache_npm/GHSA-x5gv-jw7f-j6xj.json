Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release. Current users of Claude Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced to update.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/wunderwuzzi23 for reporting this issue!","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@anthropic-ai/claude-code","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40anthropic-ai/claude-code"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-x5gv-jw7f-j6xj/GHSA-x5gv-jw7f-j6xj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gv-jw7f-j6xj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55284"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-18T18:46:52Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-16T02:15:24Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
