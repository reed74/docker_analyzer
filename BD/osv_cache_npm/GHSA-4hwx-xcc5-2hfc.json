This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to potential security risks such as data corruption or unintended code execution.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to:\n- Modify object prototypes, affecting core JavaScript behavior,\n- Cause application crashes or unexpected behavior,\n- Potentially introduce further security vulnerabilities depending on the application's architecture.\n\n## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/74c354c413ee3f82dff97a15a0a43942887c2b5b\nThe issue was resolved by ensuring that user-controlled inputs cannot modify JavaScript object prototypes.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tarteaucitronjs","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/tarteaucitronjs"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.20.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-4hwx-xcc5-2hfc/GHSA-4hwx-xcc5-2hfc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/security/advisories/GHSA-4hwx-xcc5-2hfc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31475"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/74c354c413ee3f82dff97a15a0a43942887c2b5b"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-07T16:38:52Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-07T15:15:44Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
