The vulnerability exists in the Alert Rules functionality where the alert rule name is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of HTML code.\n\n### Technical Details\n\n**Version Tested:** 25.8.0  \n**Installer File:** 25.8.0.tar.gz  \n**Download Link:** https://github.com/librenms/librenms/archive/refs/tags/25.8.0.tar.gz  \n**Platform:** N/A\n\n### Attack Vector\nWhen browsing to **Alerts > Alert Rules** page, a LibreNMS admin can add and manage alert rules. The alert rule name field is vulnerable to XSS attacks through improper sanitization.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Vulnerable Request\nWhen creating or updating an alert rule, the following HTTP POST request is sent to `/ajax_form.php`:\n\n ```\nPOST /ajax_form.php HTTP/1.1\n...\n\n_token=9YjTntCuMIe2ujpumwqJQoENRXUhJzlDt33Xu7kx&device_id=-1&device_name=&rule_id=&type=alert-rules&template_id=&builder_json=%7B%22condition%22%3A%22AND%22%2C%22rules%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22access_points.accesspoint_id%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22access_points.accesspoint_id%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22string%22%2C%22input%22%3A%22text%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22equal%22%2C%22value%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22valid%22%3Atrue%7D&name=%3Ci%3Efoo%3C%2Fi%3E&builder_rule_0_filter=access_points.accesspoint_id&builder_rule_0_operator=equal&builder_rule_0_value_0=42&severity=warning&count=1&delay=1m&interval=5m&recovery=on&acknowledgement=on&proc=&notes=&adv_query=\n```\n\n### Code Flow\n\n1. **Request Processing:** PHP script `includes/html/forms/alert-rules.inc.php` processes the request\n2. **Sanitization Attempt:** Calls `strip_tags()` to sanitize the `name` parameter\n3. **Database Operation:** Calls `dbUpdate()` or `dbInsert()` to save the rule\n\n### Bypass Technique\nThe sanitization can be bypassed using XML character references:\n\n```html\n&lt;script>alert(1)&lt;/script>\n```\n\n### Execution Path\n\n1. **Page Load:** Victim browses to Alerts > Alert Rules page\n2. **Script Execution:** `includes/html/print-alert/rules.php` is called\n3. **Modal Inclusion:** Includes `includes/html/modal/alert_rule_list.inc.php` which returns HTML for modal window\n4. **Table Rendering:** Modal contains HTML table with all rules and inline JavaScript calling `bootgrid()` function\n5. **XSS Trigger:** The `bootgrid()` function (http://www.jquery-bootgrid.com/) rewrites table cells, decoding XML character references\n6. **Code Execution:** Browser interprets the decoded payload as HTML tags and executes the injected script\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Usage\n```bash\npython3 poc.py client ip_addr -U <username> -P <password>\n```\n\n### Optional Parameters\n- `-E [kvp|multipart]` - Specify HTTP request parameter encoding\n\n## Credit\n\n**Discovered by:** Simon Humbert of Trend Research, Trend Micro\n\n## About Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)\n\nEstablished by TippingPoint and acquired by Trend Micro, the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) neither re-sells vulnerability details nor exploit code. Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor, the ZDI provides its Trend Micro TippingPoint customers with zero day protection through its intrusion prevention technology. Explicit details regarding the specifics of the vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until an official vendor patch is publicly available.\n\n## References\n\n- **ZDI Website:** http://www.zerodayinitiative.com\n- **Disclosure Policy:** http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/","affected":[{"package":{"name":"librenms/librenms","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/librenms/librenms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25.10.0"}]}],"versions":["1.19","1.20","1.20.1","1.21","1.22","1.22.01","1.23","1.24","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.32.01","1.33","1.33.01","1.34","1.35","1.36","1.36.01","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.50.1","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.62.1","1.62.2","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.65.1","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.10.1","21.10.2","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","21.9.1","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.2.2","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.4.1","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.1.1","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.8.1","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0","25.7.0","25.8.0","25.9.0","25.9.1"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 25.8.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-6g2v-66ch-6xmh/GHSA-6g2v-66ch-6xmh.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-6g2v-66ch-6xmh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62412"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/dccdf6769976a974d70f06a7ce8d5a846b29db6f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/releases/tag/25.10.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-16T20:18:32Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-16T18:15:39Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
