Both the `8.x-1.x` and `8.x-2.x` versions are unsupported, and users of either version are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a supported version of Drupal core, which includes a supported version of JSON:API.\n\nThe eventual removal of security coverage for the JSON:API contributed module was [announced with the release of JSON:API 8.x-1.22](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi/releases/8.x-1.22) on 28 June 2018.\n\nAdditionally, there is a known security issue with the 8.x-1.x branch of the project that will not be fixed by the maintainers. That issue is not present in the 8.x-2.x branch of the project, nor is it present in Drupal core.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/jsonapi","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/jsonapi"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"*"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"*","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/jsonapi/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2020-010.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2020-010"}],"credits":[{"name":"Alex Bronstein","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/78040"]},{"name":"Gabe Sullice","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2287430"]},{"name":"Mateu Aguiló Bosch","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/550110"]},{"name":"Wim Leers","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/99777"]}]}
