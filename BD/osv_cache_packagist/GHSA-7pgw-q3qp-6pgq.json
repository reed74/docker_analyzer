{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7pgw-q3qp-6pgq","published":"2025-07-10T13:10:20Z","modified":"2025-07-10T23:45:57.509741Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-53625"],"related":["CVE-2025-53625"],"summary":"DynamicPageList3 vulnerability exposes hidden/suppressed usernames","details":"### Summary\nSeveral `#dpl` parameters can leak usernames that have been hidden using revision deletion, suppression, or the `hideuser` block flag.\n\n### Details\nThe parameters `adduser`, `addauthor`, and `addlasteditor` output the page creator or last editor using the `%USER%` placeholder. These display the actual username, even when that name has been hidden using revision deletion, suppression (oversight), or `hideuser`.\n\nThe `%CONTRIBUTOR%` placeholder, used with `addcontribution`, behaves similarly and also reveals hidden usernames.\n\nIn addition, the following parameters can expose suppressed usernames when combined with `%USER%` or similar output placeholders:\n- `lastrevisionbefore`\n- `allrevisionsbefore`\n- `firstrevisionsince`\n- `allrevisionssince`\n\nThese parameters reference specific revisions and allow output of user-related metadata. If a username has been hidden from those revisions, it may still appear in the output.\n\nFurther, the parameters `createdby`, `notcreatedby`, `modifiedby`, `notmodifiedby`, `lastmodifiedby`, and `notlastmodifiedby` accept usernames as input. When the correct (suppressed) username is used, the query may return matching pages or edits. This can reveal the presence and association of a hidden identity, even if not displayed directly. However, this is a more indirect exposure than the output parameters mentioned above.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n1. Create a page while logged in as a user.\n2. Revision delete or suppress the username from the page history.\n3. Use a DPL query with one of the affected parameters.\n4. The output reveals the hidden username.\n\n#### Example\n\nThe following query reveals the suppressed username `Example user`:\n\n```wikitext\n{{#dpl:\n| title = File:Example.png\n| addauthor = true\n| format = ,%USER%,,\n}}\n```\n\nSimilar behavior occurs using parameters like `lastrevisionbefore` with `%USER%` in the `format` string.\n\n### Impact\nThis issue causes the exposure of usernames that were intentionally hidden by administrators. It directly undermines revision deletion, user suppression, and block-related privacy measures. In some cases, usernames can be revealed both directly through output and indirectly through query behavior.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"universal-omega/dynamic-page-list3","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/universal-omega/dynamic-page-list3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4"}]}],"versions":["3.3.10","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.8","3.3.9","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.4.4","3.4.5","3.4.6","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.6.2","3.6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-7pgw-q3qp-6pgq/GHSA-7pgw-q3qp-6pgq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Universal-Omega/DynamicPageList3/security/advisories/GHSA-7pgw-q3qp-6pgq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53625"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Universal-Omega/DynamicPageList3/commit/a3dae0c89fb4214390c29ceffa23bbe2099986d6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Universal-Omega/DynamicPageList3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-359"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-10T13:10:20Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-10T19:15:26Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
