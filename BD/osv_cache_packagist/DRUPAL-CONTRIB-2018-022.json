As the unserialize function is called on unauthenticated content, this introduces a PHP object injection vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/drd_agent","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/drd_agent"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.7.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.7.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/drd_agent/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2018-022.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2018-022"}],"credits":[{"name":"David Snopek","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/266527"]}]}
