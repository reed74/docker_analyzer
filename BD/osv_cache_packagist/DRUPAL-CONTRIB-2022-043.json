Visiting the entity directly resulted in correct access checks applied.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be able to view Group entities in an overview and have certain common permissions revoked.\n\nPlease note the affected versions were already unsupported, this advisory is released additionally as there are still reported installs for the affected versions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/social","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/social"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11.0.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<11.0.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<11.0.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/social/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2022-043.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2022-043"}],"credits":[{"name":"Dmitry Kiselev","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1945174"]}]}
