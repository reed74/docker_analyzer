So a user could configure the module to load JS from a malicious website.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"administer matomo\" or \"administer matomo tag manager\" (D8+ only) to access the settings forms where this can be configured.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/matomo","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/matomo"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.22.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.22.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/matomo/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-033.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-033"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3611858"]}]}
