This vulnerability arises due\n to insufficient input sanitization in the backup tool, where user-supplied paths are not properly restricted, enabling\n access to files outside the intended webroot directory. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges of \nthe user account running the application.\n```\n\n### PoC\n```\nTo accurately demonstrate the maximum potential impact of this vulnerability, the testing environment was configured in a specific way:\n\n- Elevated Privileges: The application was run locally with the highest possible system privileges, operating under the **`root`** user account.\n    \n- Objective: This configuration was chosen to unequivocally show that the path traversal vulnerability is not just a theoretical issue but can lead to a complete compromise of the underlying host when combined with poor operational practices. The ability to read any file on the system is the ultimate test of the flaw's severity.\n    \n\nProof of Concept Goal: Under these conditions, the subsequent PoC will exploit the vulnerability to read the SSH private key\n of the `root` user (`/root/.ssh/id_rsa`). The successful exfiltration of this key represents a worst-case scenario, as it would provide \nan attacker with persistent, undetectable, and complete administrative access to the host server. This highlights the critical intersection\n of an application-layer vulnerability and a infrastructure-level misconfiguration.\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n```\n1- LOGIN AS ADMIN AND  GO TO  :
