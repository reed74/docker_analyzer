The application allows unauthorized manipulation of session variables by accepting user-controlled parameters ('subject', 'server', 'database', 'queryid') without proper validation or access control checks. Attackers can exploit this to store arbitrary SQL queries in $_SESSION['sqlquery'] by manipulating these parameters, potentially leading to session poisoning, stored cross-site scripting, or unauthorized access to sensitive session data.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"phppgadmin/phppgadmin","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/phppgadmin/phppgadmin"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7.13.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-r63p-v37q-g74c/GHSA-r63p-v37q-g74c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60799"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/blob/master/sql.php#L68-L76"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pr0wl1ng/security-advisories/blob/main/CVE-2025-60799.md"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-284"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-21T18:09:49Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-20T15:17:38Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
