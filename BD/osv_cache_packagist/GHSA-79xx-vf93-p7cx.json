This menu includes the sheet names, which are not sanitized. As a result, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute JavaScript code.\n\n```php\n        // Construct HTML\n        $html = '';\n\n        // Only if there are more than 1 sheets\n        if (count($sheets) > 1) {\n            // Loop all sheets\n            $sheetId = 0;\n\n            $html .= '<ul class=\"navigation\">' . PHP_EOL;\n\n            foreach ($sheets as $sheet) {\n                $html .= '  <li class=\"sheet' . $sheetId . '\"><a href=\"#sheet' . $sheetId . '\">' . $sheet->getTitle() . '</a></li>' . PHP_EOL;\n                ++$sheetId;\n            }\n\n            $html .= '</ul>' . PHP_EOL;\n        }\n```\n\n### PoC\n1. Create an XLSX file with multiple sheets : \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fc027a-9525-4d7f-b107-cfa6e78d04e7)\n\n2. Generate the HTML content \n```php\n<?php\n\trequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n\t$inputFileName = 'payload.xlsx';\n\t$spreadsheet = \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\IOFactory::load($inputFileName);\n\t$writer = new \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html($spreadsheet);\n\t$writer->writeAllSheets();\n\techo $writer->generateHTMLAll();\n?>\n```\n3.
