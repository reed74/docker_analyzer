For example: routes that have the `_role` requirement, can be bypassed with an access token.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the access token in possession and the user related to the token must have the associated (role requirement) roles assigned.\n\n*Update: the Affected versions field was updated to reflect that this vulnerability was present in the 6.0.0 release and fixed in 6.0.7. Earlier versions of this advisory incorrectly stated that other versions were affected.*","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/simple_oauth","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/simple_oauth"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.7"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=6.0.0 <6.0.7"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":">=6.0.0 <6.0.7","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/simple_oauth/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-114.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-114"}],"credits":[{"name":"coffeemakr","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/coffeemakr"]}]}
