It provides a text filter and a Twig filter.\n\nThe typogrify Twig filter can be used to bypass the Twig auto-escape feature, leading to a persistent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it is only exposed when the twig filter is specifically used in a template to render content.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/typogrify","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/typogrify"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.3.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.3.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/typogrify/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-002"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3611858"]}]}
