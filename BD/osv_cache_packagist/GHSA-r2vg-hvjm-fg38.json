However, using a custom crafted request, a customer can still cancel his own orders.As this is not checked inside the route (and also not in the controller):\nhttps://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Storefront/Controller/AccountOrderController.php#L98\nhttps://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Core/Checkout/Order/SalesChannel/CancelOrderRoute.php\n\nTo mitigate this, a check should be added to the `CancelOrderRoute` which verifies that the feature is enabled.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"shopware/platform","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/shopware/platform"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.3.1"}]}],"versions":["v6.7.0.0","v6.7.0.1","v6.7.1.0","v6.7.1.1","v6.7.1.2","v6.7.2.0","v6.7.2.1","v6.7.2.2","v6.7.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-r2vg-hvjm-fg38/GHSA-r2vg-hvjm-fg38.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shopware/platform","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/shopware/platform"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.10.7"}]}],"versions":["6.3.0.0","6.3.0.1","6.3.0.2","6.3.1.0","6.3.1.1","6.3.2.0","6.3.2.1","6.3.3.0","6.3.3.1","6.3.4.0","6.3.4.1","6.3.5.0","6.3.5.1","6.3.5.2","6.3.5.3","6.3.5.4","6.4.0.0","6.4.0.0-RC1","6.4.1.0","6.4.1.1","6.4.1.2","6.4.10.0","6.4.10.1","6.4.11.0","6.4.11.1","6.4.12.0","6.4.13.0","6.4.14.0","6.4.15.0","6.4.15.1","6.4.15.2","6.4.16.0","6.4.16.1","6.4.17.0","6.4.17.1","6.4.17.2","6.4.18.0","6.4.18.1","6.4.19.0","6.4.2.0","6.4.2.1","6.4.20.0","6.4.20.1","6.4.20.2","6.4.3.0","6.4.3.1","6.4.4.0","6.4.4.1","6.4.5.0","6.4.5.1","6.4.6.0","6.4.6.1","6.4.7.0","6.4.8.0","6.4.8.1","6.4.8.2","6.4.9.0","6.5.0.0","6.5.0.0-rc1","6.5.0.0-rc2","6.5.0.0-rc3","6.5.0.0-rc4","v6.0.0+ea2","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.1.0-rc3","v6.1.0-rc4","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-RC1","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.5.1.0","v6.5.1.1","v6.5.2.0","v6.5.2.1","v6.5.3.0","v6.5.3.1","v6.5.3.2","v6.5.3.3","v6.5.4.0","v6.5.4.1","v6.5.5.0","v6.5.5.1","v6.5.5.2","v6.5.6.0","v6.5.6.1","v6.5.7.0","v6.5.7.1","v6.5.7.2","v6.5.7.3","v6.5.7.4","v6.5.8.0","v6.5.8.1","v6.5.8.10","v6.5.8.11","v6.5.8.12","v6.5.8.13","v6.5.8.14","v6.5.8.15","v6.5.8.16","v6.5.8.17","v6.5.8.18","v6.5.8.2","v6.5.8.3","v6.5.8.4","v6.5.8.5","v6.5.8.6","v6.5.8.7","v6.5.8.8","v6.5.8.9","v6.6.0.0","v6.6.0.0-rc1","v6.6.0.0-rc2","v6.6.0.0-rc3","v6.6.0.0-rc4","v6.6.0.0-rc5","v6.6.0.0-rc6","v6.6.0.0-rc7","v6.6.0.1","v6.6.0.2","v6.6.0.3","v6.6.1.0","v6.6.1.1","v6.6.1.2","v6.6.10.0","v6.6.10.1","v6.6.10.2","v6.6.10.3","v6.6.10.4","v6.6.10.5","v6.6.10.6","v6.6.2.0","v6.6.3.0","v6.6.3.1","v6.6.4.0","v6.6.4.1","v6.6.5.0","v6.6.5.1","v6.6.6.0","v6.6.6.1","v6.6.7.0","v6.6.7.1","v6.6.8.0","v6.6.8.1","v6.6.8.2","v6.6.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-r2vg-hvjm-fg38/GHSA-r2vg-hvjm-fg38.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shopware/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/shopware/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.3.1"}]}],"versions":["v6.7.0.0","v6.7.0.1","v6.7.1.0","v6.7.1.1","v6.7.1.2","v6.7.2.0","v6.7.2.1","v6.7.2.2","v6.7.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-r2vg-hvjm-fg38/GHSA-r2vg-hvjm-fg38.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shopware/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/shopware/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.10.7"}]}],"versions":["6.3.0.0","6.3.0.1","6.3.0.2","6.3.1.0","6.3.1.1","6.3.2.0","6.3.2.1","6.3.3.0","6.3.3.1","6.3.4.0","6.3.4.1","6.3.5.0","6.3.5.1","6.3.5.2","6.3.5.3","6.3.5.4","6.4.0.0","6.4.0.0-RC1","6.4.1.0","6.4.1.1","6.4.1.2","6.4.10.0","6.4.10.1","6.4.11.0","6.4.11.1","6.4.12.0","6.4.13.0","6.4.14.0","6.4.15.0","6.4.15.1","6.4.15.2","6.4.16.0","6.4.16.1","6.4.17.0","6.4.17.1","6.4.17.2","6.4.18.0","6.4.18.1","6.4.19.0","6.4.2.0","6.4.2.1","6.4.20.0","6.4.20.1","6.4.20.2","6.4.3.0","6.4.3.1","6.4.4.0","6.4.4.1","6.4.5.0","6.4.5.1","6.4.6.0","6.4.6.1","6.4.7.0","6.4.8.0","6.4.8.1","6.4.8.2","6.4.9.0","6.5.0.0","6.5.0.0-rc1","6.5.0.0-rc2","6.5.0.0-rc3","6.5.0.0-rc4","v6.0.0+ea2","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.1.0-rc3","v6.1.0-rc4","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-RC1","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.5.1.0","v6.5.1.1","v6.5.2.0","v6.5.2.1","v6.5.3.0","v6.5.3.1","v6.5.3.2","v6.5.3.3","v6.5.4.0","v6.5.4.1","v6.5.5.0","v6.5.5.1","v6.5.5.2","v6.5.6.0","v6.5.6.1","v6.5.7.0","v6.5.7.1","v6.5.7.2","v6.5.7.3","v6.5.7.4","v6.5.8.0","v6.5.8.1","v6.5.8.10","v6.5.8.11","v6.5.8.12","v6.5.8.13","v6.5.8.14","v6.5.8.15","v6.5.8.16","v6.5.8.17","v6.5.8.18","v6.5.8.2","v6.5.8.3","v6.5.8.4","v6.5.8.5","v6.5.8.6","v6.5.8.7","v6.5.8.8","v6.5.8.9","v6.6.0.0","v6.6.0.0-rc1","v6.6.0.0-rc2","v6.6.0.0-rc3","v6.6.0.0-rc4","v6.6.0.0-rc5","v6.6.0.0-rc6","v6.6.0.0-rc7","v6.6.0.1","v6.6.0.2","v6.6.0.3","v6.6.1.0","v6.6.1.1","v6.6.1.2","v6.6.10.0","v6.6.10.1","v6.6.10.2","v6.6.10.3","v6.6.10.4","v6.6.10.5","v6.6.10.6","v6.6.2.0","v6.6.3.0","v6.6.3.1","v6.6.4.0","v6.6.4.1","v6.6.5.0","v6.6.5.1","v6.6.6.0","v6.6.6.1","v6.6.7.0","v6.6.7.1","v6.6.8.0","v6.6.8.1","v6.6.8.2","v6.6.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-da
