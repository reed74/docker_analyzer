While this is an expected feature, the module does not sufficiently restrict this functionality to trusted users with a \"restricted access\" permission. Users without a restricted permission should not be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission *create [bundle] content* permission.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/minisite","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/minisite"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.2"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.0.2"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.0.2","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/minisite/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-117.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-117"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
