Sites are encouraged to review which roles have that permission and which users have that role, to ensure that only trusted users have that permission.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/file_extractor","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/file_extractor"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.3"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.0.3"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.0.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"3.0.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"last_affected":"4.0.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"4.0.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.0.3 || 3.0.0 || 4.0.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/file_extractor/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2021-033.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-033"}],"credits":[{"name":"Florent Torregrosa","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2388214"]}]}
