To mitigate the vulnerability without upgrading sites could disable public registration.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/saml_sp","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/saml_sp"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.7.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.7.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/saml_sp/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2020-006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2020-006"}],"credits":[{"name":"J Proctor","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1194192"]}]}
