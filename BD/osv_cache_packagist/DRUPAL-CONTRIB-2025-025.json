The module provides a custom formatter for link fields.\n\nDrupal core does not sufficiently sanitize link element attributes, which can lead to a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS).\n\nA separate fix for Drupal core has been released but this module requires a concurrent release to make use of the Drupal core fix.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by that fact that an attacker would need to have the ability to add specific attributes to a Link field, which typically requires edit access via core web services, or a contrib or custom module.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/rapidoc_elements_field_formatter","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/rapidoc_elements_field_formatter"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.0.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.0.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/rapidoc_elements_field_formatter/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-025.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-025"}],"credits":[{"name":"Joseph Zhao (pandaski)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/pandaski"]}]}
