A malicious provider could execute a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must 1) have a role with the permission \"administer oembed providers\", 2) have a role with the ability to create or edit Media entities, and 3) have provisioned a publicly-accessible, malicious provider.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/oembed_providers","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/oembed_providers"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.2"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.2.2"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.2.2","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/oembed_providers/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-048.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-048"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
