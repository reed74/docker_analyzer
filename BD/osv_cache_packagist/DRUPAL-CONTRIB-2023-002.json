This may result in users with access to edit content seeing metadata about entities they are not authorized to access.\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the inaccessible entities will only be visible to users who can already edit content using Entity Browser.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/entity_browser","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/entity_browser"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.9.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.9.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/entity_browser/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-002"}],"credits":[{"name":"Lee Rowlands","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/395439"]}]}
