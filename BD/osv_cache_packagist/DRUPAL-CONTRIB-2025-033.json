Additionally, only simple blocks can be added or edited, as a more complex block will trigger an error due to missing permissions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/panels","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/panels"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<4.9.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<4.9.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/panels/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-033.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-033"}],"credits":[{"name":"Manuel Adán (manuel.adan)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/manueladan"]}]}
