An attacker that can create or edit certain entities or configuration may be able to exploit one or more Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to target visitors of the site, including site admins with privileged access.\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated by the facts, that:\n\n* An attacker must have one of several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only assigned to either editors, site builders or administrators.\n* For some of the vulnerabilities, certain contributed modules must be enabled.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/govuk_theme","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/govuk_theme"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.9.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.9.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/govuk_theme/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2022-027.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2022-027"}],"credits":[{"name":"Patrick Fey","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/998680"]}]}
