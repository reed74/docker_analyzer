This value is directly inserted into a `<script>` tag, making the site vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission *Administer gtm*, and the input field is limited to 20 characters.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/gtm","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/gtm"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.10.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.10.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/gtm/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-094.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-094"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
