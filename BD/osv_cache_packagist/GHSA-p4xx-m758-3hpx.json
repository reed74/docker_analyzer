{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-p4xx-m758-3hpx","published":"2025-05-20T19:20:55Z","modified":"2025-05-20T20:13:27.507693Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-47936"],"summary":"TYPO3 CMS Webhooks Server Side Request Forgery","details":"### Problem\nWebhooks are inherently vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to target internal resources (e.g., _localhost_ or other services on the local network). While this is not a vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> **Manual actions required**\n>\n> To mitigate potential SSRF risks via webhooks, it is recommended to explicitly allow access only to trusted hosts. This can be achieved by configuring the allowlist in `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']['allowed_hosts']['webhooks']`.\n> \n> If the allowlist is not defined or set to `null`, all requests will be allowed.\n> If the allowlist is an empty `array`, all requests will be blocked.\n> \n> By default, the factory setting allows all requests. This prevents existing webhooks from failing after upgrading to the affected TYPO3 versions. Administrators must configure this setting manually to enforce restrictions.\n\n\n### Credits\nThanks to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of Switzerland for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"typo3/cms-webhooks","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/cms-webhooks"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"12.0.0"},{"fixed":"12.4.31"}]}],"versions":["v12.3.0","v12.4.0","v12.4.1","v12.4.10","v12.4.11","v12.4.12","v12.4.13","v12.4.14","v12.4.15","v12.4.16","v12.4.17","v12.4.18","v12.4.19","v12.4.2","v12.4.20","v12.4.21","v12.4.22","v12.4.23","v12.4.24","v12.4.25","v12.4.26","v12.4.27","v12.4.28","v12.4.29","v12.4.3","v12.4.30","v12.4.4","v12.4.5","v12.4.6","v12.4.7","v12.4.8","v12.4.9"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 12.4.30","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-p4xx-m758-3hpx/GHSA-p4xx-m758-3hpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/cms-webhooks","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/cms-webhooks"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"13.0.0"},{"fixed":"13.4.12"}]}],"versions":["v13.0.0","v13.0.1","v13.1.0","v13.1.1","v13.2.1","v13.3.0","v13.3.1","v13.4.0","v13.4.1","v13.4.10","v13.4.11","v13.4.2","v13.4.3","v13.4.4","v13.4.5","v13.4.6","v13.4.7","v13.4.8","v13.4.9"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 13.4.11","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-p4xx-m758-3hpx/GHSA-p4xx-m758-3hpx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-p4xx-m758-3hpx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47936"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3-CMS/webhooks/commit/0df8b8adae577876fa253679c9ef3fe2a7ee64fd"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3-CMS/webhooks"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2025-012"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-20T19:20:55Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-20T14:15:50Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
