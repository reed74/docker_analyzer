An attacker must gather additional information regarding the entry form after authentication. An attacker must still present a valid token to complete authentication.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/tfa","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/tfa"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.8.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.8.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/tfa/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-043.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-043"}],"credits":[{"name":"Francesco Placella","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/183211"]}]}
