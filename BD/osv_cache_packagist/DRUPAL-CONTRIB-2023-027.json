It curently is using the 'access content' permission and not a proper administrative/access permission.\n\nThe vulnerability/library information can be exploited by simply visiting/knowing the url of the reporting page. The solution is to protect the page via a module specific permission that must be granted by an administrative user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/libraries_ui","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/libraries_ui"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.1.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.1.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/libraries_ui/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-027.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-027"}],"credits":[{"name":"Jörg Riemenschneider","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2809357"]}]}
