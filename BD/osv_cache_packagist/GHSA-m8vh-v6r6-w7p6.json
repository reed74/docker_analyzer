{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-m8vh-v6r6-w7p6","published":"2025-12-02T00:46:05Z","modified":"2025-12-02T01:28:15.021183Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-66305"],"summary":"Grav vulnerable to Denial of Service via Improper Input Handling in 'Supported' Parameter","details":"**Endpoint**: `admin/config/system`  \n**Submenu**: `Languages`  \n**Parameter**: `Supported`  \n**Application**: Grav v 1.7.48\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nA Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was identified in the **\"Languages\"** submenu of the Grav **admin configuration panel** (`/admin/config/system`). Specifically, the `Supported` parameter fails to properly validate user input. If a malformed value is inserted—such as a single forward slash (`/`) or an XSS test string—it causes a fatal regular expression parsing error on the server.\n\nThis leads to application-wide failure due to the use of the `preg_match()` function with an **improperly constructed regular expression**, resulting in the following error:\n\n`preg_match(): Unknown modifier 'o' File: /system/src/Grav/Common/Language/Language.php line 244`\n\nOnce triggered, the site becomes completely unavailable to all users.\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n- **Vulnerable Endpoint**: `POST /admin/config/system`\n    \n- **Submenu**: `Languages`\n    \n- **Parameter**: `Supported`  \n    \n\nThe application dynamically constructs a regular expression using the contents of the `Supported` field without escaping the input using `preg_quote()` or proper validation. This allows attackers to inject invalid syntax into the regex engine, crashing the application during language resolution.\n\n**Stack trace excerpt**:\n\n`Whoops \\ Exception \\ ErrorException (E_WARNING) preg_match(): Unknown modifier 'o' /system/src/Grav/Common/Language/Language.php244`\n\n---\n\n## Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n### Payloads:\n\n`/ `\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Log into the Grav Admin Panel.\n    \n2. Navigate to: **Configuration** → **System** → **Languages**.\n    \n3. Locate the `Supported` field.\n    \n4. Insert one of the payloads above (e.g., a single slash `/`).\n    \n5. Click **Save**.\n\n<img width=\"1897\" height=\"639\" alt=\"Pasted image 20250719183223\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a54a20-d30d-46c6-9015-722f80701cfb\" />\n\n1.
