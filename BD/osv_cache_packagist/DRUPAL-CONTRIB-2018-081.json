(This means certain `GET` requests are vulnerable; no `POST`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` requests are vulnerable.)\n\nIn order to fix this issue, two new hooks were added: `hook_jsonapi_ENTITY_TYPE_filter_access()` and `hook_jsonapi_entity_field_filter_access()`. Sites with custom entity types and/or with entity or field access customizations may need to implement these newly introduced hooks.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/jsonapi","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/jsonapi"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.24.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.24.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/jsonapi/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2018-081.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2018-081"}],"credits":[{"name":"Gabe Sullice","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2287430"]},{"name":"Lauri Eskola","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1078742"]}]}
