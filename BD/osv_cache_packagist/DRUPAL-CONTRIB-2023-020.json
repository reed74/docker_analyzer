The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with a role with the permission \"administer display\" regardless of other configurations. In some scenarios, the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with \"Create content\" or \"Edit content\" for a relevant Content type.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/office_hours","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/office_hours"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.11"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.11","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/office_hours/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-020.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-020"}],"credits":[{"name":"John Voskuilen","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/591042"]},{"name":"Mitch Portier","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2284182"]}]}
