This enables your site to take advantage of the many features which the Swift Mailer library provides.\n\nThe module could allow an attacker to gain widespread access to a Drupal site. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a means to trigger sending an email with a body that they can control, which would requires either another contributed module or custom integration.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/swiftmailer","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/swiftmailer"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"*"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"*","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/swiftmailer/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-006"}],"credits":[{"name":"Adam Shepherd","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2650563"]}]}
