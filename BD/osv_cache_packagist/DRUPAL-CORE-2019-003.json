This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases.\n\nA site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met:\n\n* The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows **GET**, PATCH or POST requests, or\n* the site has another web services module enabled, like [JSON:API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) in Drupal 8, or [Services](https://www.drupal.org/project/services) or [RESTful Web Services](https://www.drupal.org/project/restws) in Drupal 7.\n\n(*Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at this time, but you should still apply other contributed updates associated with this advisory if Services is in use.*)\n\nUpdates\n-------\n\n* **2019-02-22**: Updated risk score given new information; see [PSA-2019-02-22](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-02-22). The security risk score has been updated to 23/25 as there are now known exploits in the wild. In addition, any enabled REST resource end-point, **even if it only accepts GET requests**, is also vulnerable. Note this does not include REST exports from Views module.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.5.11"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">= 8.0.0 <8.5.11"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"8.6.0"},{"fixed":"8.6.10"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=8.6.0 <8.6.10"}}],"versions":["8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.0.4","8.0.5","8.0.6","8.1.0","8.1.0-beta1","8.1.0-beta2","8.1.0-rc1","8.1.1","8.1.10","8.1.2","8.1.3","8.1.4","8.1.5","8.1.6","8.1.7","8.1.8","8.1.9","8.2.0","8.2.0-beta1","8.2.0-beta2","8.2.0-beta3","8.2.0-rc1","8.2.0-rc2","8.2.1","8.2.2","8.2.3","8.2.4","8.2.5","8.2.6","8.2.7","8.2.8","8.3.0","8.3.0-alpha1","8.3.0-beta1","8.3.0-rc1","8.3.0-rc2","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.3.4","8.3.5","8.3.6","8.3.7","8.3.8","8.3.9","8.4.0","8.4.0-alpha1","8.4.0-beta1","8.4.0-rc1","8.4.0-rc2","8.4.1","8.4.2","8.4.3","8.4.4","8.4.5","8.4.6","8.4.7","8.4.8","8.5.0","8.5.0-alpha1","8.5.0-beta1","8.5.0-rc1","8.5.1","8.5.10","8.5.2","8.5.3","8.5.4","8.5.5","8.5.6","8.5.7","8.5.8","8.5.9","8.6.0","8.6.1","8.6.2","8.6.3","8.6.4","8.6.5","8.6.6","8.6.7","8.6.8","8.6.9"],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":">= 8.0.0 <8.5.11 || >=8.6.0 <8.6.10","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/core/DRUPAL-CORE-2019-003.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-003"}],"credits":[{"name":"Samuel Mortenson","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2582268"]}]}
