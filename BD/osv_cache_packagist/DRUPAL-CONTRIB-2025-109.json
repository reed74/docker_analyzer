While this is an expected feature, the permission lacks the \"restrict access\" flag, which should alert administrators that this permission is potentially dangerous and can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission “administer umami analytics”.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/umami_analytics","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/umami_analytics"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.0.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.0.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/umami_analytics/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-109.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-109"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
