This can allow an attacker to apply other people's orders to their own, getting credit without paying.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have some knowledge about the module's internal functionality. The issue only affects installations that use the Mollie for Drupal Commerce submodule.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/mollie","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/mollie"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.2.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.2.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/mollie/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-052"}],"credits":[{"name":"Norbert Arends","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/660798"]},{"name":"Rico Van de Vin","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1243726"]}]}
