A Simple Consent Manager\" to your website and allows you to configure it according to your needs in the Drupal backend.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently mark its administrative permission as restricted, creating the possibility for the permission to be granted too broadly. A malicious admin could execute a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the \"administer simple klaro\" permission.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/simple_klaro","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/simple_klaro"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.10.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.10.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/simple_klaro/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-071.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-071"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
