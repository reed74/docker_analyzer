It may be possible to escalate this attack to Remote Code Execution. It is not directly exploitable.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that for it to be exploitable, a separate vulnerability must be present to allow an attacker to pass unsafe input to `unserialize()`. The potential vulnerability exists in optional Automator Types which are part of the optional AI Automators (sub)module.\n\nThe AI module is included in Drupal CMS.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/ai","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/ai"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.5"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.0.5"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.0.5","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/ai/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-022.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-022"}],"credits":[{"name":"Drew Webber (mcdruid)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/mcdruid"]}]}
