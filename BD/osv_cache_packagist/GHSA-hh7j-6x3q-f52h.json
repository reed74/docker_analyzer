In contrast you get a success response if the account was found.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to Shopware 6.6.10.3\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.5 or 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"shopware/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/shopware/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.10.3"}]}],"versions":["v6.6.0.0","v6.6.0.1","v6.6.0.2","v6.6.0.3","v6.6.1.0","v6.6.1.1","v6.6.1.2","v6.6.10.0","v6.6.10.1","v6.6.10.2","v6.6.2.0","v6.6.3.0","v6.6.3.1","v6.6.4.0","v6.6.4.1","v6.6.5.0","v6.6.5.1","v6.6.6.0","v6.6.6.1","v6.6.7.0","v6.6.7.1","v6.6.8.0","v6.6.8.1","v6.6.8.2","v6.6.9.0"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<=
