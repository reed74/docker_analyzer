The token refresh and client credentials grants are not affected.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the vast majority of OAuth 2.0 clients in the wild are public, not confidential. Furthermore, all affected grant types still require users to authenticate to Drupal during the OAuth flow.\n\nThe implicit grant type is insecure for other reasons (and still requires user authentication) and is disabled by default.\n\nSites at risk of information disclosure would be specifically configured to restrict access based on the OAuth client's confidentiality status and configured scopes, not only traditional Drupal user permissions and roles.\n\nFurther mitigation includes [configuring allowed redirect URIs for clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.3.5). This is an OAuth best practice for guarding against man-in-the-middle attacks on authorization codes, and prevents redirection to imposter clients.\n\nAnyone implementing OAuth 2.0 on their Drupal site is also encouraged to review the [relevant RFCs and Internet-Drafts](https://oauth.net/security/) pertaining to OAuth security.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/simple_oauth","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/simple_oauth"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.6.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<4.6.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0"},{"fixed":"5.0.6"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=5.0.0 <5.0.6"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<4.6.0 || >=5.0.0 <5.0.6","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/simple_oauth/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2022-002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2022-002"}],"credits":[{"name":"Simon Bäse","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3686593"]}]}
