This vulnerability allows administrators to create accounts with extremely weak and predictable passwords, such as `12345678`. This exposes the platform to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n**Vulnerable Component:** User creation / password definition\n\nThe application fails to enforce a strong password policy when creating new users. As a result, administrators can define trivial and well-known weak passwords, compromising the authentication security of the system.\n\n---\n\n## PoC\n\n1. Log in to the application using an **Administrator** account.\n    \n2. Navigate to the user management section:  \n      \n3. Create a new user account using the password `12345678`.\n    \n\n<img width=\"1103\" height=\"852\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a20d4226-9f86-46ee-a4e6-45be91bb6b7b\" />\n\n4. The application accepts the weak password without restrictions and creates the account successfully.\n    \n<img width=\"1359\" height=\"487\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bec15bf-b38f-448b-8f98-acca5724e143\" />\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nWeak password policy vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, including:\n\n- Increased risk of brute-force and credential stuffing attacks\n    \n- Unauthorized access to user or administrative accounts\n    \n- Privilege escalation through compromised credentials\n    \n- Degradation of the overall security posture of the platform\n    \n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Enforce a strong password policy (e.g., minimum of 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).\n    \n- Block the use of commonly known weak passwords (e.g., `12345678`, `password`, `admin`, `qwerty`).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"librenms/librenms","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/librenms/librenms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25.11.0"}]}],"versions":["1.19","1.20","1.20.1","1.21","1.22","1.22.01","1.23","1.24","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.32.01","1.33","1.33.01","1.34","1.35","1.36","1.36.01","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.50.1","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.62.1","1.62.2","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.65.1","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.10.1","21.10.2","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","21.9.1","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.2.2","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.4.1","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.1.1","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.8.1","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.10.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0","25.7.0","25.8.0","25.9.0","25.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-5mrf-j8v6-f45g/GHSA-5mrf-j8v6-f45g.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-5mrf-j8v6-f45g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65014"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-521"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-18T18:24:26Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-18T23:15:56Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
