These hashes can be used for authentication instead of the user's password, e.g. for views exporters.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently invalidate page output when the page\\_cache module is used.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a user hash that grants access to specific content and the attack must be timed to the reset of the page cache.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/user_hash","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/user_hash"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.0.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.0.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/user_hash/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2021-030.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-030"}],"credits":[{"name":"Jürgen Haas","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/168924"]},{"name":"Lee Rowlands","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/395439"]}]}
