In a default Drupal installation this would require the administrator role and use of the Full HTML text format. It also requires that the ROT13 encoding be enabled in Obfuscate settings.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/obfuscate","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/obfuscate"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.0.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.0.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/obfuscate/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-029.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-029"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
