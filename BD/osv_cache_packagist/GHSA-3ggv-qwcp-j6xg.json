This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames, after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched, implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.\n\n### Technical Details\nThe vulnerability was caused by different response times when:\n- A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)\n- An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)\n\nThe fix introduces a `TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator` that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users, ensuring consistent timing.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are available. Users should upgrade to the patched version.\n\n### References\n- https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account\n- https://github.com/mautic/mautic-security/pull/146","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mautic/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mautic/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.4.0"},{"fixed":"4.4.17"}]}],"versions":["4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.10","4.4.11","4.4.12","4.4.13","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.4.4","4.4.5","4.4.6","4.4.7","4.4.8","4.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mautic/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mautic/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-alpha"},{"fixed":"5.2.8"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0","5.0.0-alpha","5.0.0-alpha1","5.0.0-beta1","5.0.0-beta2","5.0.0-rc1","5.0.0-rc2","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.2.6","5.2.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mautic/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mautic/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0-alpha"},{"fixed":"6.0.5"}]}],"versions":["6.0.0","6.0.0-alpha","6.0.0-beta2","6.0.0-rc","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9824"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mautic/mautic/commit/6bc4f5f1aabb13df12714ad0ea9fc281cbb867c6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mautic/mautic/commit/b4264c717ce31fbafafcefc04b02ecb9fb911e62"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mautic/mautic"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-204"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-03T22:20:16Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-03T15:15:49Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
