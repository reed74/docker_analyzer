However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces.\n\nAs a result, even with the secure configuration shown above, an attacker can inject dangerous attributes into applications using this extension via a payload such as:\n\n```md\n![](){onerror=alert(1)}\n```\n\nWhich results in the following HTML:\n\n```html\n<p><img onerror=\"alert(1)\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n```\n\nWhich causes the JS to execute immediately on page load.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector:\n\n- All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default\n- [Support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.7/extensions/attributes/#configuration)\n- Manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not feasible, please consider:\n\n- Disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users\n- [Filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/#additional-filtering)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"league/commonmark","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/league/commonmark"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.10.0","0.11.0","0.11.1","0.11.2","0.11.3","0.12.0","0.13.0","0.13.1","0.13.2","0.13.3","0.13.4","0.14.0","0.15.0","0.15.1","0.15.2","0.15.3","0.15.4","0.15.5","0.15.6","0.15.7","0.16.0","0.17.0","0.17.1","0.17.2","0.17.3","0.17.4","0.17.5","0.18.0","0.18.1","0.18.2","0.18.3","0.18.4","0.18.5","0.19.0","0.19.1","0.19.2","0.19.3","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.8.0","0.9.0","1.0.0","1.0.0-beta1","1.0.0-beta2","1.0.0-beta3","1.0.0-beta4","1.0.0-rc1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.7","1.5.8","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.6.7","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta1","2.0.0-beta2","2.0.0-beta3","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.8","2.3.9","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/security/advisories/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46734"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/commit/f0d626cf05ad3e99e6db26ebcb9091b6cd1cd89b"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-05T20:40:36Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-05T20:15:21Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
