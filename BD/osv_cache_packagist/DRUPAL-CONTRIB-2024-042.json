The tab shows all revisions like standard Drupal but it also allows pretty viewing of all added/changed/deleted words between revisions.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently check revision access before rendering a diff report for 1) nodes or 2) general entities that support diff.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission from the general node permission to \"view all revisions\", one of the more specific node type permissions, \"view %bundle revisions\" or the equivalent for other general entity types.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/diff","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/diff"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.8.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0-beta1"},{"fixed":"2.0.0-beta3"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=2.0.0-beta1 <2.0.0-beta3"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.8.0 || >=2.0.0-beta1 <2.0.0-beta3","patched":true,"source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/diff/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-042.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-042"}],"credits":[{"name":"Matthias Vogel","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3319139"]}]}
