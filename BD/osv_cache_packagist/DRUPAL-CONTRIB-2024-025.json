In order for assets to be managed in Drupal, a site administrator must first authenticate the site to their DAM instance.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently protect the ability to disconnect a site from DAM. While disconnected sites do not lose asset data in Drupal, it will prevent site editors from accessing the DAM until a site administrator re-authenticates the site. Some uncached media images may also fail to be fetched while disconnected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/acquia_dam","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/acquia_dam"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.13"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.0.13"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.1.0-beta1"},{"fixed":"1.1.0-beta3"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=1.1.0-beta1 <1.1.0-beta3"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.0.13 || >=1.1.0-beta1 <1.1.0-beta3","patched":true,"source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/acquia_dam/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-025.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-025"}],"credits":[{"name":"Matt Glaman","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2416470"]}]}
