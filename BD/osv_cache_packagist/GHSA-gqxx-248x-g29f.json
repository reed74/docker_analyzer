{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-gqxx-248x-g29f","published":"2025-12-02T01:23:19Z","modified":"2025-12-02T02:16:15.975431Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-66308"],"summary":"Grav Admin Plugin vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Stored endpoint `/admin/config/site` parameter `data[taxonomies]`","details":"## Summary\n\nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `/admin/config/site` endpoint of the _Grav_ application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `data[taxonomies]` parameter. The injected payload is stored on the server and automatically executed in the browser of any user who accesses the affected site configuration, resulting in a persistent attack vector.\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `POST /admin/config/site`  \n**Parameter:** `data[taxonomies]`\n\nThe application does not properly validate or sanitize input in the `data[taxonomies]` field. As a result, an attacker can inject JavaScript code, which is stored in the site configuration and later rendered in the administrative interface or site output, causing automatic execution in the user's browser.\n\n---\n\n## PoC\n\n**Payload:**\n\n`\"><script>alert('XSS-PoC')</script>`\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Log in to the _Grav_ Admin Panel with sufficient permissions to modify site configuration.\n    \n2. Navigate to **Configuration > Site**.\n    \n3. In the **Taxonomies Types** field (which maps to `data[taxonomies]`), insert the payload above:\n          \n    `\"><script>alert('XSS-PoC')</script>`\n    \n4. Save the configuration.\n\n<img width=\"1897\" height=\"628\" alt=\"Pasted image 20250718195942\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2035fcaa-34fc-494c-a7ca-7c1e1f34b057\" />\n    \n5. Go on Pages and click on one of them\n\n<img width=\"932\" height=\"587\" alt=\"Pasted image 20250718200306\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c1995ba-2581-4e27-ae9d-a17e2eeb5b57\" />\n    \n6. The stored payload is executed immediately in the browser, confirming the Stored XSS vulnerability.\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"377\" alt=\"Pasted image 20250718200353\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad8ea7ea-603f-4b84-aa5a-120de0cb56ce\" />\n    \n7. The HTTP request submitted during this process contains the vulnerable parameter and payload:\n    \n<img width=\"757\" height=\"675\" alt=\"Pasted image 20250718200445\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbbe2b76-00eb-4426-8ddd-5cde2cc65d77\" />\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nStored XSS attacks can lead to severe consequences, including:\n\n- **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies or authentication tokens to impersonate users\n    \n- **Credential theft:** Harvesting usernames and passwords using malicious scripts\n    \n- **Malware delivery:** Distributing unwanted or harmful code to victims\n    \n- **Privilege escalation:** Compromising administrative users through persistent scripts\n    \n- **Data manipulation or defacement:** Changing or disrupting site content\n    \n- **Reputation damage:** Eroding trust among site users and administrators\n    \n\n---\n\n## Discoverer\n\n[Marcelo Queiroz](www.linkedin.com/in/marceloqueirozjr)
