This may reveal submitted data or allow an attacker to modify submitted data. Additionally, for sites with webforms that send emails and store submissions this vulnerability would allow an attacker to use the site as an email relay (i.e. sending arbitrary emails).\n\nThere is no mitigation for this vulnerability. If you have the Webform Node module enabled you must update the Webform module.\n\n### Cross Site Scripting:\n\nThe Webform module enables site builders to create forms and surveys.\n\nThe Webform module doesn't sufficiently filter HTML when an element's 'Help title' and an 'Image Select' element's image text contain specially crafted malicious text.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be able to create or edit webforms.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/webform","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/webform"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.6"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=6.0.0 <6.0.6"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.2"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=6.1.0 <6.1.2"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":">=6.0.0 <6.0.6 || >=6.1.0 <6.1.2","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/webform/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2021-045.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-045"}],"credits":[{"name":"Adam P","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3580554"]},{"name":"Madelyn Cruz","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2523544"]},{"name":"Rohit Tiwari","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3132219"]}]}
