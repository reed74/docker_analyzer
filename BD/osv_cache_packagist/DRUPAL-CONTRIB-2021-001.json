The information is usually only available for logged-in users of the community.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that `social_auth_extra` needs to be enabled, one of the single sign-on methods needs to be configured. There is no impact for regular registration without single sign-on.\n\nRemoving the single sign-on providers from configuration will allow this vulnerability to be blocked.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/social","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/social"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.10.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<8.10.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"9.0.0"},{"fixed":"9.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=9.0.0 <9.8.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<8.10.0 || >=9.0.0 <9.8.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/social/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2021-001.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-001"}],"credits":[{"name":"Alexander Varwijk","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1868952"]}]}
