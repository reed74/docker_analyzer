The validateReference method, however, uses the original non-canonicalized version of SignedInfo.\n\n### Impact\nIf an attacker somehow (i.e. by exploiting a bug in PHP's canonicalization function) manages to manipulate the canonicalized version's DigestValue, it would be potentially be possible to forge the signature. No possibilities to exploit this were found during the investigation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"simplesamlphp/xml-security","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/simplesamlphp/xml-security"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.6.11"},{"fixed":"1.6.12"}]}],"versions":["1.6.11","v1.6.11"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"simplesamlphp/saml2","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/simplesamlphp/saml2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-alpha.12"},{"fixed":"5.0.0-alpha.13"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0-alpha.12","v5.0.0-alpha.12"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/security/advisories/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49087"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/commit/f509e3083dd7870cce5880c804b5122317287581"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/blob/master/src/XML/SignedElementTrait.php"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-345"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-11-28T18:52:19Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-11-30T06:15:47Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
