The vulnerable parameter is `content`, which permits the injection of arbitrary HTML code during the email sending process. While JavaScript code injection is blocked through filtering, HTML code injection remains possible.\n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce the vulnerability, a user must fill out the email's content form with the desired HTML payload.\n![send-test-mail-text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e02b004-ce88-4018-b7cb-ae15a8ec2300)\n\n### Impact\n![mail-text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67080d10-0cef-4f65-a157-4f012203f0a3)\n\nThis HTML injection vulnerability can potentially enable phishing attacks by allowing the insertion of any html like fake login forms, etc.\nAll functionalities that process user input should be carefully reviewed to ensure that data is appropriately encoded as HTML entities in server responses. For instance, a reflected input paramete like `<h1> just a test </h1> <p> <img>` should be displayed in the HTML response as `&#x3c;h1&#x3e; just a test &#x3c;/h1&#x3e; &#x3c;p&#x3e; &#x3c;img&#x3e;`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.6"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-BETA1","v1.0.0-RC1","v1.0.0-RC2","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-RC1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.2","v1.2.0-RC1","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-RC1","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-RC1","v1.5.0-RC2","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-RC1","v1.6.0-RC2","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-x82r-6j37-vrgg/GHSA-x82r-6j37-vrgg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-x82r-6j37-vrgg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30166"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/76b690d4f8fcd9c9d41766bc5238c2513242e60e"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-08T14:51:41Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-08T11:15:44Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
