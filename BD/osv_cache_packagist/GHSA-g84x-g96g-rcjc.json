When a user views or interacts with the page displaying the data, the malicious script executes immediately, leading to potential unauthorized actions or data exposure.\n\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\n1. Navigate to the /addhost path.\n2. Fill in all required fields.\n3. In the Community field, enter the following payload: `\"><img src=a onerror=\"alert(1)\">`.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/025a7692-e730-4e3b-bca7-761ed2a60cf7)\n\n4. Submit the form to save changes.\n5 The script will execute when the error alert \"No reply with community + payload\" appears.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4663e24a-4ff7-42f4-9c3d-3c5b5bf34017)\n\n\n\n**Impact:**\n\nExecution of Malicious Code","affected":[{"package":{"name":"librenms/librenms","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/librenms/librenms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.11.0"}]}],"versions":["1.19","1.20","1.20.1","1.21","1.22","1.22.01","1.23","1.24","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.32.01","1.33","1.33.01","1.34","1.35","1.36","1.36.01","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.50.1","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.62.1","1.62.2","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.65.1","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.10.1","21.10.2","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","21.9.1","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.2.2","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.4.1","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.1.1","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.8.1","24.9.0","24.9.1"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 24.10.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-g84x-g96g-rcjc/GHSA-g84x-g96g-rcjc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-g84x-g96g-rcjc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23201"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-16T17:33:10Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-01-16T23:15:08Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
