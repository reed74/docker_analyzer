When the user's browser receives the response, the malicious code is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of the user's account.\n\n### Details\nOn the latest version of Redaxo, v5.18.2, the rex-api-result parameter is vulnerable to Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on the page of AddOns.\n\n### PoC\n1. Login Redaxo as administrative user.\n2. Navigate to the URL: [http://localhost/redaxo/index.php?page=packages&rex-api-call=package&&rex-api-result={%22succeeded%22%3Atrue%2C%22message%22%3A%22%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain);%3E%22}](http://localhost/redaxo/index.php?page=packages&rex-api-call=package&&rex-api-result=%7B%22succeeded%22%3Atrue%2C%22message%22%3A%22%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain);%3E%22%7D), the XSS executes.\n\n![2025-02-14_13-45](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cb0f01a-7562-473b-8101-1bc59532e746)\n\n\n### Impact\nThis can lead to various security risks, including session hijacking, phishing attacks and malware distribution.
