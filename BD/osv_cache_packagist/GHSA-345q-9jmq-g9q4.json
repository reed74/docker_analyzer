Sites where PHP is configured with zend.exception_ignore_args = 'On' or zend.exception_ignore_args = 1 in the relevant php.ini file are NOT affected by this vulnerability. Sites that do not have the zend.exception_ignore_args setting enabled and are using the internal Moodle LMS authentication system are affected by this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"moodle/moodle","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/moodle/moodle"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.5.0-beta"},{"fixed":"4.5.3"}]}],"versions":["v4.5.0","v4.5.0-beta","v4.5.0-rc1","v4.5.0-rc2","v4.5.1","v4.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-345q-9jmq-g9q4/GHSA-345q-9jmq-g9q4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32044"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/moodle/moodle/commit/41917db65e6b3dba3bf3d805a8599e6752655646"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-32044"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2356829"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/moodle/moodle"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-25T16:31:47Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-25T15:15:36Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
