This bug therefore allows users to log in even if their login is disabled.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/login_disable","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/login_disable"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=2.0.0 <2.1.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":">=2.0.0 <2.1.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/login_disable/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-073.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-073"}],"credits":[{"name":"e5sego","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/261590"]}]}
