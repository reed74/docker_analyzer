The project maintainer did not follow the terms and conditions for hosting projects on drupal.org that are opted into security coverage, so the module is losing its security coverage. The private issues may be made public at the discretion of the reporter and maintainer.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/advanced_file_destination","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/advanced_file_destination"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"*"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"*","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/advanced_file_destination/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-057.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-057"}],"credits":[{"name":"Conrad Lara (cmlara)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/cmlara"]}]}
