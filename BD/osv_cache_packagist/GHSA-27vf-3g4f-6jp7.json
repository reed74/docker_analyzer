When a user views or interacts with the page displaying the data, the malicious script executes immediately, leading to potential unauthorized actions or data exposure.\n\n\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\n1. Add a new device through the LibreNMS interface.\n2. Edit the newly created device and select the \"ports\" section.\n3. In the \"Description\" field, enter the following payload: `\"><img src onerror=\"alert(1)\">`.\n4. Save the changes.\n5. The XSS vulnerability is triggered when accessing the \"ports\" tab, and the payload is executed again when hovering over the modified value in the \"Port\" field.\n\nPayload:\n![payload](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f38b985-6684-403f-9d1f-e405f09a75bb)\n\nExecutes:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70a6e34-d52c-4113-b769-4e271e33de88)\nThe script execution vulnerability in the description field, as shown in the image, occurs at [Line 63 of functions.inc.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/master/includes/html/functions.inc.php#L63)\n```php\n$overlib_content = '<div class=overlib><span class=overlib-text>' . $text .
