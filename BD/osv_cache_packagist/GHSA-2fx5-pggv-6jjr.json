via Parsing Differences","details":"### Problem\nApplications that use `TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Http\\Uri` to parse externally provided URLs (e.g., via a query parameter) and validate the host of the parsed

12.4.25 LTS, 13.4.3 LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Sam Mush and Christian Eßl who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed
