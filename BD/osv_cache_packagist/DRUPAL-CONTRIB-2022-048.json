Normally the Drupal Security Team would not issue advisories related to 3rd party code that is shipped separately from a module per our policy (most recent update is [PSA-2019-09-04](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-09-04)). In this case, because the module required a specific version and could not be updated without a change to the Drupal module we do issue an advisory.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/entity_print","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/entity_print"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.6.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.6.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/entity_print/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2022-048.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2022-048"}],"credits":[{"name":"Munavir P k","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3604066"]},{"name":"szato","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/389677"]}]}
