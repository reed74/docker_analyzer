An attacker could send many requests and exhaust disk resources.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact it only affects sites where the Origin is configured with a trailing slash. Sites that cannot upgrade immediately can confirm they do not have a trailing slash or remove the trailing slash to mitigate the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/stage_file_proxy","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/stage_file_proxy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.5"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.1.5"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.1.5","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/stage_file_proxy/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-035.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-035"}],"credits":[{"name":"Ide Braakman (idebr)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/idebr"]}]}
