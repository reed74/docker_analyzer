This issue does **not** affect email-based MFA. It also only applies when recovery codes are enabled.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf an attacker gains access to both the user's password and their recovery codes, they can repeatedly complete MFA without the user's app-based second factor. This weakens the expected security of MFA by turning recovery codes into a static, long-term bypass method.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"filament/filament","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/filament/filament"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1"}]}],"versions":["v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.10","v4.0.11","v4.0.12","v4.0.13","v4.0.14","v4.0.15","v4.0.16","v4.0.17","v4.0.18","v4.0.19","v4.0.2","v4.0.20","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8","v4.0.9","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.10","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.1.6","v4.1.7","v4.1.8","v4.1.9","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-pvcv-q3q7-266g/GHSA-pvcv-q3q7-266g.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/security/advisories/GHSA-pvcv-q3q7-266g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67507"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/commit/87ff60ad9b6e16d4e14ee36a220b8917dd7b0815"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-288"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-09T17:19:10Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-10T01:15:52Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
