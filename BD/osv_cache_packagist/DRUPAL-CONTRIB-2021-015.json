This is a followup to more fully implement the fixes from [SA-CONTRIB-2021-009](https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-009)\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that successful exploitation requires special conditions in place such as custom blockAccess() method that differs from the default return value of 'AccessResult::allowed()' and extending from EntityView.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/ctools","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/ctools"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.7.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.7.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/ctools/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2021-015.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-015"}],"credits":[{"name":"Michael Vanetta","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/452914"]}]}
