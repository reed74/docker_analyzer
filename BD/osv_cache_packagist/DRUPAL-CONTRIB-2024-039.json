This can cause errors when a logging module (e.g. dblog or syslog) attempts to parse the resulting log message which contains invalid data.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that to be affected a site must have seckit's CSP reporting functionality enabled. Recent versions of Drupal 10 and 11 core are not vulnerable due to [improved parsing of log messages](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2481349).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/seckit","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/seckit"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.3"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.0.3"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.0.3","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/seckit/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2024-039.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-039"}],"credits":[{"name":"_b0lli","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3827467"]}]}
