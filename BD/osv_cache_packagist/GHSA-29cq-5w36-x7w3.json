All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version or later as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround at this time. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version immediately.\n\n### Resources\nNo public references available at this time to avoid exposure. Details will be published after a responsible disclosure window.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"livewire/livewire","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/livewire/livewire"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0-beta.1"},{"fixed":"3.6.4"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-beta.10","v3.0.0-beta.11","v3.0.0-beta.2","v3.0.0-beta.3","v3.0.0-beta.4","v3.0.0-beta.5","v3.0.0-beta.6","v3.0.0-beta.7","v3.0.0-beta.8","v3.0.0-beta.9","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.10","v3.4.11","v3.4.12","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.4.5","v3.4.6","v3.4.7","v3.4.8","v3.4.9","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.10","v3.5.11","v3.5.12","v3.5.13","v3.5.14","v3.5.15","v3.5.16","v3.5.17","v3.5.18","v3.5.19","v3.5.2","v3.5.20","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.6","v3.5.7","v3.5.8","v3.5.9","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-29cq-5w36-x7w3/GHSA-29cq-5w36-x7w3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-29cq-5w36-x7w3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54068"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/ef04be759da41b14d2d129e670533180a44987dc"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/livewire/livewire"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/livewire/livewire/releases/tag/v3.6.4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-17T20:26:45Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-17T19:15:25Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
