By doing so, some regular node access checks turned from neutral into allowed because of the way the node grants system operates.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the victim must have the GroupNode plugin installed on their website and have no other `hook_node_grants()` implementations on their website aside from the one that was recently removed by Group. If you do not use the GroupNode plugin or still have `hook_node_grants()` implementing modules enabled, your site may not be affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/group","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/group"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"last_affected":"1.0.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"1.0.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"1.0.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/group/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2020-030.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2020-030"}],"credits":[{"name":"Kristiaan Van den Eynde","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1345130"]}]}
