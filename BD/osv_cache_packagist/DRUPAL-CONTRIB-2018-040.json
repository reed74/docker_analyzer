The module also does not protect against Cross Site Request Forgeries on its delete process.\n\nThe access bypass vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"access content\". There is no additional mitigation for the Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/entity_delete","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/entity_delete"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.4.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.4.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/entity_delete/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2018-040.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2018-040"}],"credits":[{"name":"Balazs Janos Tatar","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/649590"]}]}
