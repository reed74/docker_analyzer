Additionally, only data sent in the email is visible, so the attacker cannot access the content on the site.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/content_moderation_notifications","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/content_moderation_notifications"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.6.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=3.0.0 <3.6.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":">=3.0.0 <3.6.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/content_moderation_notifications/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-047.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-047"}],"credits":[{"name":"lucasantunes","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3603448"]}]}
