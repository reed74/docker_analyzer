This creates a scenario where after such a user is blocked from logging in through the identity provider but not explicitly blocked in Drupal, they are still able to log in by sending themselves a Drupal 'password reset' e-mail.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/samlauth","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/samlauth"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.1.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.1.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/samlauth/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2021-006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-006"}],"credits":[{"name":"Bobby Gryzynger","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3311649"]},{"name":"Mark Shropshire","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/14767"]}]}
