An attacker (or legitimate user) with valid credentials can authenticate using the REST login endpoint (`/user/login?_format=json`) or other HTTP-based authentication routes, effectively bypassing the module’s protection of the UI login page.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must already possess valid account credentials.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/disable_login","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/disable_login"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.3"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.1.3"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.1.3","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/disable_login/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-124.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-124"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
