The XmlScanner decodes the sheet1.xml from an .xlsx to utf-8 if something else than UTF-8 is declared in the header. This was a security measurement to prevent CVE-2018-19277 but the fix is not sufficient. By double-encoding the the xml payload to utf-7 it is possible to bypass the check for the string ?<!ENTITY? and thus allowing for an xml external entity processing (XXE) attack.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"phpoffice/phpspreadsheet","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-beta","1.0.0-beta2","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6.0","1.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2019/11/GHSA-vvwv-h69m-wg6f/GHSA-vvwv-h69m-wg6f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"phpoffice/phpexcel","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/phpoffice/phpexcel"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.8.2"}]}],"versions":["1.7.9","1.7.9-rc1","1.8.0","1.8.0rc1","1.8.0rc2","1.8.0rc3","1.8.0rc4","1.8.1","1.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2019/11/GHSA-vvwv-h69m-wg6f/GHSA-vvwv-h69m-wg6f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12331"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1041"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/commit/0e6238c69e863b58aeece61e48ea032696c6dccd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/CVE-2019-12331.yaml"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#180---2019-07-01"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/releases/tag/1.8.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2019-0046"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-611"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2019-11-19T03:41:04Z","nvd_published_at":"2019-11-07T15:15:10Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
