This allows an attacker with product creation privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated by the backend — potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.\n\n### Details\nIn Bagisto, product descriptions are rendered through Laravel’s Blade templating engine in various front-end and admin views. The product description field is not sanitized or escaped before being passed to the view, which means user-supplied data can break out of the expected string context and execute arbitrary template code.\n\n### PoC\nCreate a product and enter the payload to the description.\n<img width=\"679\" height=\"669\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e5dac3f-4043-4b31-98ed-f4346feb5477\" />\nPreview the page, observed that the template expressions were evaluated by the backend and displayed on the screen.\n<img width=\"1431\" height=\"922\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f29c6e-05f4-40c4-9926-0c59e0a979c2\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nRCE potential: Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code or system commands.\nData breach: Read sensitive environment variables (.env), API keys, or database credentials.\nDefacement / persistence: Inject malicious scripts or backdoors in dynamic templates.\nPrivilege escalation: If attackers have limited roles (e.g., product manager), they can compromise the entire application or host.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bagisto/bagisto","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/bagisto/bagisto"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.8"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.4-BETA1","v0.1.4-BETA2","v0.1.4-BETA3","v0.1.4-BETA4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.6-ALPHA1","v0.1.7","v0.1.7-BETA1","v0.1.7-BETA2","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.1.9-BETA1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-BETA1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-BETA1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-BETA-1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 2.3.7","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-527q-4wqv-g9wj/GHSA-527q-4wqv-g9wj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/security/advisories/GHSA-527q-4wqv-g9wj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62416"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336","CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-16T20:28:35Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-16T19:15:34Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
