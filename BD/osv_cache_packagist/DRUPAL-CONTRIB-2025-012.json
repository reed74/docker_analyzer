The routes involved are not protected against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker needs to know the machine name of the container. The machine name is a random string, making an attack more difficult.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/google_tag","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/google_tag"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.8.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.8"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=2.0.0 <2.0.8"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.8.0 || >=2.0.0 <2.0.8","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/google_tag/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-012.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-012"}],"credits":[{"name":"Florent Torregrosa","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/2388214"]},{"name":"Pierre Rudloff","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3611858"]}]}
