Edit/save custom content that supplies a value for the `data-target` attribute by injecting malicious code.\n2. Inject custom markup onto the page that further exploits the `data-target` attribute by injecting malicious code. This method of attack is highly unlikely if they already have this level of access.\n\nNote: while the base-theme does not provide either of these opportunities to do this out-of-the-box; a custom sub-theme may, however, be susceptible if it didn't sanitize or filter user provided input for XSS properly.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/bootstrap","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.14.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.14.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.14.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/bootstrap/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2018-074.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2018-074"}],"credits":[{"name":"Gomez_in_the_South","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/153735"]}]}
