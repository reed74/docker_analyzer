First, an attacker must have a way to insert results in the dataset that is exposed as a facet before this can happen. The permission to inject malicious strings depends on the site's search configuration but could be available to any user who can create content in a site. Second, the site must be using the Javascript-based dropdown widget.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/facets","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/facets"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.3.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.3.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/facets/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2019-030.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2019-030"}],"credits":[{"name":"Ide Braakman","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/1879760"]}]}
