This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to clone segments without proper authorization checks.\n\nInsecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / Missing Authorization: A missing authorization vulnerability exists in the `cloneAction` of the segment management. This allows an authenticated user to bypass intended permission restrictions and clone segments even if they lack the necessary permissions to create new ones.\n\n### Mitigation\nUpdate Mautic to a version that implements proper authorization checks for the `cloneAction` within the `ListController.php`. Ensure that users attempting to clone segments possess the appropriate creation permissions.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\nEmail us at security@mautic.org","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mautic/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mautic/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-alpha"},{"fixed":"5.2.6"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0","5.0.0-alpha","5.0.0-alpha1","5.0.0-beta1","5.0.0-beta2","5.0.0-rc1","5.0.0-rc2","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-vph5-ghq3-q782/GHSA-vph5-ghq3-q782.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mautic/core","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mautic/core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0-alpha"},{"fixed":"6.0.2"}]}],"versions":["6.0.0","6.0.0-alpha","6.0.0-beta2","6.0.0-rc","6.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-vph5-ghq3-q782/GHSA-vph5-ghq3-q782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-vph5-ghq3-q782"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47055"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mautic/mautic"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-284","CWE-862"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-28T17:38:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-28T18:15:24Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
