Sites could mitigate the issue without updating by:\n\n1. disabling the access code login method for critical accounts\n2. monitor and prevent brute force attacks in other ways (for example, with a Web Application Firewall)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/access_code","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/access_code"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.4"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.0.4"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.0.4","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/access_code/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-028.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-028"}],"credits":[{"name":"Marcin Maruszewski (marcin maruszewski)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/marcin-maruszewski"]}]}
