It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. \nThe fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks Myq Larson for reporting.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"concrete5/concrete5","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/concrete5/concrete5"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"9.0.0"},{"fixed":"9.4.0RC2"}]}],"versions":["9.0.0","9.0.1","9.0.2","9.1.0","9.1.1","9.1.2","9.1.3","9.2.0","9.2.0RC2","9.2.1","9.2.2","9.2.3","9.2.4","9.2.5","9.2.6","9.2.7","9.2.8","9.2.9","9.3.0","9.3.1","9.3.2","9.3.3","9.3.4","9.3.5","9.3.6","9.3.7","9.3.8","9.3.9","9.4.0RC1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-cmm4-p9v2-q453/GHSA-cmm4-p9v2-q453.json"}},{"package":{"name":"concrete5/concrete5","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/concrete5/concrete5"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.5.20"}]}],"versions":["8.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.2.0RC2","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.4.0","8.4.0RC3","8.4.0RC4","8.4.1","8.4.2","8.4.3","8.4.4","8.4.5","8.5.0","8.5.0RC1","8.5.0RC2","8.5.1","8.5.10","8.5.11","8.5.12","8.5.13","8.5.14","8.5.15","8.5.16","8.5.17","8.5.18","8.5.19","8.5.2","8.5.3","8.5.4","8.5.5","8.5.6","8.5.6RC1","8.5.7","8.5.8","8.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-cmm4-p9v2-q453/GHSA-cmm4-p9v2-q453.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3153"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12511"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12512"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://documentation.concretecms.org/9-x/developers/introduction/version-history/940-release-notes"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/releases/tag/8.5.20"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-04T14:19:09Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-03T02:15:20Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
