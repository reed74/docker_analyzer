This so-called \"gadget chain\" presents no direct threat but is a vector that can be used to achieve remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted data due to another vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nHas the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?\n\nThe problem is patched with Version 1.4.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPatch `src/Goodby/CSV/Export/Standard/Collection /CallbackCollection.php`:\n\n```diff\n+    public function __wakeup() {\n+       throw new \\BadMethodCallException('Cannot unserialize ' . __CLASS__);\n+    }\n```\n\nHowever, this is not directly exploitable; a separate vulnerability must be present to allow an attacker to pass unsafe input to unserialize(). There are no such known exploits in goodby-csv.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_","affected":[{"package":{"name":"handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.3"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-x3c7-22c8-prg7/GHSA-x3c7-22c8-prg7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv/security/advisories/GHSA-x3c7-22c8-prg7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49597"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv/commit/acd14c6ed85116bb2cb4da35ab62821e5cf54519"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-915"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-13T21:09:00Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-13T20:15:23Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
