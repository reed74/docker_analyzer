Additionally your schema must make use of the EntityLabel DataProducer to be affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/graphql","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/graphql"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<3.4.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.6.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=4.0.0 <4.6.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<3.4.0 || >=4.0.0 <4.6.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/graphql/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2023-050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-050"}],"credits":[{"name":"Dezső Biczó","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/315522"]}]}
