Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger this by sending a malicious serialized object, which forces excessive memory usage, rendering Adminer’s interface unresponsive and causing a server-level DoS. While the server may recover after several minutes, multiple simultaneous requests can cause a complete crash requiring manual intervention.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vrana/adminer","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/vrana/adminer"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.8.1"}]}],"versions":["v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.4.0","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.7.5","v4.7.6","v4.7.7","v4.7.8","v4.7.9","v4.8.0","v4.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-mqh4-2mm8-g7w9/GHSA-mqh4-2mm8-g7w9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43960"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/far00t01/CVE-2025-43960"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vrana/adminer"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-25T21:50:01Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-25T14:15:30Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L"}]}
