Due to bad naming of the permissions it's likely admins have configured those to users that shouldn't have them.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"view booking\" or \"view booking contact\".","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/bookable_calendar","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/bookable_calendar"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.13"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.2.13"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.2.13","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/bookable_calendar/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-070.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-070"}],"credits":[{"name":"Ludo Hartzema (absoludo)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/absoludo"]}]}
