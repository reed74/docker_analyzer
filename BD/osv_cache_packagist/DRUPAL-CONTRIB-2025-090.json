You can specify an attribute name to be added to the block in a predefined format.\n\nThe module does not sufficiently validate the provided attributes, which makes it possible to insert JavaScript event attributes such as `onmouseover`, `onkeyup`, etc. These attributes can execute JavaScript code when the page is rendered, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nThis vulnerability is partially mitigated by the requirement to manually add the specific attributes and corresponding JavaScript code to the form after the attribute has been created.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/block_attributes","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/block_attributes"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.1.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.1"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=2.0.0 <2.0.1"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.1.0 || >=2.0.0 <2.0.1","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/block_attributes/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-090.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-090"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff (prudloff)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/prudloff"]}]}
