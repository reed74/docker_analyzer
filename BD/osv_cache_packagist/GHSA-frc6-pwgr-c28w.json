When an administrator creates a new Alert Transport, the value of the `Transport name` field is stored and later rendered in the **Transports** column of the **Alert Rules** page without proper input validation or output encoding. This leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the admin’s browser.\n\n### Details\n\n* **Injection point:** `Transport name` field in `/alert-transports`.\n* **Execution point:** **Transports** column in `/alert-rules`.\n* **Scope:** Only administrators can create Alert Transports, and only administrators can view the affected Alert Rules page. Therefore, both exploitation and impact are limited to admin users.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Log in with an administrator account.\n2. Navigate to:\n\n   ```\n   http://localhost:8000/alert-transports\n   ```\n3. Click **Create alert transport** and provide the following values:\n\n   * **Transport name:**\n\n     ```html\n     'onfocus='alert(1)' autofocus=\n     ```\n   * **Default Alert:** `ON`\n   * **Email:** `test@gmail.com` (or any valid email)\n   \n    Save the transport.\n   \n4. Navigate to ```http://localhost:8000/alert-rules```. A popup `alert(1)` is triggered, confirming that the payload executes.\n<img width=\"1829\" height=\"396\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932ba17d-214d-4253-80b8-62539d1cfa28\" />\n\n### Impact\n\nOnly accounts with the admin role who access the **Alert Rules** page (`http://localhost:8000/alert-rules`) are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"librenms/librenms","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/librenms/librenms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25.10.0"}]}],"versions":["1.19","1.20","1.20.1","1.21","1.22","1.22.01","1.23","1.24","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.32.01","1.33","1.33.01","1.34","1.35","1.36","1.36.01","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.50.1","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.62.1","1.62.2","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.65.1","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.10.1","21.10.2","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","21.9.1","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.2.2","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.4.1","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.1.1","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.8.1","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0","25.7.0","25.8.0","25.9.0","25.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-frc6-pwgr-c28w/GHSA-frc6-pwgr-c28w.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-frc6-pwgr-c28w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62411"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/706a77085f4d5964f7de9444208ef707e1f79450"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/e1ead366239b57e88f9a06d4f7c213b1e2530cd8"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/releases/tag/25.10.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-16T16:52:13Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-16T18:15:39Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
