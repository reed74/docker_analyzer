A user with this permission can load a GTM container that completely changes the page or inserts malicious JS, resulting in a cross site scripting vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the aforementioned permission.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/google_tag","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/google_tag"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<1.8.0"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.8"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=2.0.0 <2.0.8"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<1.8.0 || >=2.0.0 <2.0.8","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/google_tag/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2025-011.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2025-011"}],"credits":[{"name":"Pierre Rudloff","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/user/3611858"]}]}
