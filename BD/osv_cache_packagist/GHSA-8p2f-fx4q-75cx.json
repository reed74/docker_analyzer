However, users without the “Delete” privilege for Products cannot delete a single product via the standard endpoint (expected behavior), but can still delete products via the mass-delete endpoint, even when the request contains only one product ID.\n\n**Severity**: High CVSS Score 8.1 (CVSS 3.1 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H&version=3.1))\n**Category**: Broken Access Control / Missing Authorization (OWASP A01:2021)\n**Impact**: Unauthorized product deletion -> data loss, possible business disruption\n\n### Affected Behavior\n**Single delete (enforced):**\n**DELETE** `/admin/catalog/products/{id}` returns 401 with \"This action is unauthorized\" for users lacking the Delete privilege.\n\n**Mass delete (not enforced):**\n**POST** `/admin/catalog/products/mass-delete` allows deletion without the Delete privilege. This occurs for both multiple IDs and a single ID submitted to the bulk endpoint.\n\n### PoC\nA video was captured in Burp Suite for a proof of concept.
