This allows authenticated users with member-level permissions to bypass system admin restrictions and add or remove users to/from private channels via the playbook run participants feature, even when the 'Manage Members' permission has been explicitly removed. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive channel content and allow guest users to gain channel management privileges.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.0.0-20250513065225-4ae5d647fb88"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.0.0-20250513065225-4ae5d647fb88"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"9.11.0"},{"fixed":"9.11.16"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"10.5.0"},{"fixed":"10.5.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"10.6.0"},{"fixed":"10.6.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"10.7.0"},{"fixed":"10.7.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"10.8.0"},{"fixed":"10.8.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6/GHSA-v8fr-vxmw-6mf6.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46702"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/commit/31142f101e3cce6171e2b6cb4980a1aa8eaefae0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/commit/4ae5d647fb8893d77dccbb57d114855939a775ce"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://mattermost.com/security-updates"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-30T20:40:33Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-30T17:15:32Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
