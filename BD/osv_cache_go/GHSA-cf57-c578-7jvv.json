While most modern browsers do not allow a redirect to `javascript:` URLs, it could still trigger dangerous behavior in some cases.\n\n`GET https://example.com/.within.website/?redir=javascript:alert()` responds with `Location: javascript:alert()`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAnybody with a subrequest authentication seems affected. Using `javascript:` URLs will probably be blocked by most modern browsers, but using custom protocols for third-party applications might still trigger dangerous operations.\n\n### Note\n\nThis was originally reported by @mbiesiad against Weblate.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.23.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-cf57-c578-7jvv/GHSA-cf57-c578-7jvv.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/security/advisories/GHSA-cf57-c578-7jvv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64716"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/commit/7ed1753fcced351c81961bf520a7bfb2caac6e88"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-4086"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601","CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-30T17:08:12Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-13T03:16:29Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:N"}]}
