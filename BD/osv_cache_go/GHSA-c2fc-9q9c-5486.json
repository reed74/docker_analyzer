An attacker may try to guess the password one character at a time by sending all possible characters to a vulnerable mechanism and measuring the comparison instruction’s execution times.\nThe vulnerability is shown in figure 8.1, where both the username and password are compared with a short-circuiting equality operation.\n\n```golang\nif user != proxy.basicAuth.Username || pass != proxy.basicAuth.Password {\n```\n\nIt is currently undetermined what an attacker may be able to do with access to the proxy password.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Trail of Bits, you can see the [full report](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-c2fc-9q9c-5486/GHSA-c2fc-9q9c-5486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"d7y.io/dragonfly/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/d7y.io/dragonfly/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-c2fc-9q9c-5486/GHSA-c2fc-9q9c-5486.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/security/advisories/GHSA-c2fc-9q9c-5486"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59350"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3972"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-208","CWE-697"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-17T20:02:30Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-17T20:15:37Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
