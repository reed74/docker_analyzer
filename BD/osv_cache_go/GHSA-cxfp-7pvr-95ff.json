This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node.\n\n# Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nDisable usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.\n\n# Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank Rodrigo Campos Catelin and Piotr Rogowski for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n#  For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at security@containerd.io\n\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.1"},{"fixed":"2.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 2.0.4","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-cxfp-7pvr-95ff/GHSA-cxfp-7pvr-95ff.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-cxfp-7pvr-95ff"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47291"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3701"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-266"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-21T18:01:48Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-21T18:15:52Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
