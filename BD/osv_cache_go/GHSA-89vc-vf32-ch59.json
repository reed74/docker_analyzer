Any user with network access to the Manager can create, delete, and modify jobs, and create preheat jobs.\n\nAn unauthenticated adversary with network access to a Manager web UI uses /api/v1/jobs endpoint to create hundreds of useless jobs. The Manager is in a denial-of-service state, and stops accepting requests from valid administrators.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Trail of Bits, you can see the [full report](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-89vc-vf32-ch59/GHSA-89vc-vf32-ch59.json"}},{"package":{"name":"d7y.io/dragonfly/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/d7y.io/dragonfly/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-89vc-vf32-ch59/GHSA-89vc-vf32-ch59.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/security/advisories/GHSA-89vc-vf32-ch59"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59345"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3965"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-306"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-17T19:21:26Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-17T19:15:47Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
