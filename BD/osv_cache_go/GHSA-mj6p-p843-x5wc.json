The Operator creates a ServiceAccount with *ClusterRole* upon deployment of the *Namespace-Scoped* Custom Resource MonitorStack. This issue allows an adversarial Kubernetes Account with only namespaced-level roles, for example, a tenant controlling a namespace, to create a MonitorStack in the authorized namespace and then elevate permission to the cluster level by impersonating the ServiceAccount created by the Operator, resulting in privilege escalation and other issues.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/rhobs/observability-operator","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/rhobs/observability-operator"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-mj6p-p843-x5wc/GHSA-mj6p-p843-x5wc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2843"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rhobs/observability-operator/commit/98b927fab755decd6e030ac6af5c005879bab020"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21146"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-2843"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2355222"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/rhobs/observability-operator"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rhobs/observability-operator/releases/tag/v1.3.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-266"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-14T21:39:19Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-12T17:15:37Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
