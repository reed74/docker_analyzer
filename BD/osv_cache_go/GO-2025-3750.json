On Unix systems, OpenFile with O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags never follows symlinks. On Windows, when the target path was a symlink to a nonexistent location, OpenFile would create a file in that location. OpenFile now always returns an error when the O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags are both set and the target path is a symlink.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stdlib","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.23.10"},{"introduced":"1.24.0-0"},{"fixed":"1.24.4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"imports":[{"goos":["windows"],"path":"syscall","symbols":["Open"]},{"goos":["windows"],"path":"os","symbols":["Chdir","Chmod","Chown","CopyFS","Create","CreateTemp","File.ReadDir","File.Readdir","File.Readdirnames","Getwd","Lchown","Link","Lstat","Mkdir","MkdirAll","MkdirTemp","NewFile","Open","OpenFile","OpenInRoot","OpenRoot","Pipe","ReadDir","ReadFile","Remove","RemoveAll","Rename","Root.Create","Root.Lstat","Root.Mkdir","Root.Open","Root.OpenFile","Root.OpenRoot","Root.Remove","Root.Stat","StartProcess","Stat","Symlink","Truncate","WriteFile","dirFS.Open","dirFS.ReadDir","dirFS.ReadFile","dirFS.Stat","rootFS.Open","rootFS.ReadDir","rootFS.ReadFile","rootFS.Stat","unixDirent.Info"]}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://vuln.go.dev/ID/GO-2025-3750.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://go.dev/cl/672396"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/73702"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/ufZ8WpEsA3A"}],"database_specific":{"review_status":"REVIEWED","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3750"},"credits":[{"name":"Junyoung Park and Dong-uk Kim of KAIST Hacking Lab"}]}
