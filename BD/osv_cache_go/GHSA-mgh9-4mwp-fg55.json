This upgrade is backwards compatible.\n\n### Workaround\nDowngrade to v1.9.2 with enable-check-optimizations removed from OPENFGA_EXPERIMENTALS\n\n### Acknowledgments\nOpenFGA would like Dominic Harries and rrozza-apolitical to thank for discovering this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/openfga/openfga","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/openfga/openfga"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.9.3"},{"fixed":"1.9.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-mgh9-4mwp-fg55/GHSA-mgh9-4mwp-fg55.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-mgh9-4mwp-fg55"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55213"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/1a7e0e37fc4777c824b2386cac4867a66f3480b0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3894"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-18T21:00:52Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-18T20:15:29Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
