In this case, the attacker created a playlist, added song, posted arbitrary comment, set the playlist to be public, and put the admin as the owner of the playlist.\n\n### Impact\nEach known user is impacted. An attacker can obtain the ownerId from shared playlist information, meaning every user who has shared a playlist is also impacted, as they can be impersonated.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/navidrome/navidrome","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/navidrome/navidrome"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.52.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4jrx-5w4h-3gpm/GHSA-4jrx-5w4h-3gpm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/security/advisories/GHSA-4jrx-5w4h-3gpm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32963"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-01T08:29:48Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-05-01T07:15:40Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
