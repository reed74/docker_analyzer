The ClusterDeployment.hive.openshift.io/v1 resource can be created with the spec.installed field set to true, regardless of the installation status, and a positive timespan for the spec.hibernateAfter value. If a ClusterSync.hiveinternal.openshift.io/v1alpha1 resource is also created, the hive hibernation controller will enter the reconciliation loop leading to a panic when accessing a non-existing field in the ClusterDeployment’s status section, resulting in a denial of service.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/openshift/hive","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/openshift/hive"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.1.16"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-c392-wrgw-jjfw/GHSA-c392-wrgw-jjfw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25132"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-25132"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2260371"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/openshift/hive"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-20T13:18:17Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-19T18:15:20Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
