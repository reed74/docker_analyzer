For example, if an application is hosted on https://example.com and adds example.net to TrustedOrigins, a network attacker can serve a form at http://example.net to perform the attack.\n\nApplications should migrate to net/http.CrossOriginProtection, introduced in Go 1.25. If that is not an option, a backport is available as a module at filippo.io/csrf, and a drop-in replacement for the github.com/gorilla/csrf API is available at filippo.io/csrf/gorilla.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/gorilla/csrf","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gorilla/csrf"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.7.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-82ff-hg59-8x73/GHSA-82ff-hg59-8x73.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47909"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/golang/vulndb/issues/3884"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/gorilla/csrf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3884"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352","CWE-807"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-29T20:23:16Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-29T16:15:35Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
