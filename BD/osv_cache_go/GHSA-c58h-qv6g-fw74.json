The parameter ssid for defining a session id is not used through the MPC implementation, which makes replaying and spoofing of messages easier. In particular, the Schnorr proof of knowledge implemented in sch.go does not utilize a session id, context, or random nonce in the generation of the challenge. This could allow a malicious user or an eavesdropper to replay a valid proof sent in the past.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/04/GHSA-c58h-qv6g-fw74/GHSA-c58h-qv6g-fw74.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/04/GHSA-c58h-qv6g-fw74/GHSA-c58h-qv6g-fw74.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47930"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/pull/256"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/commit/1a14f3ac9ecbf6115e80d44c7fff16bcc3139250"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IoFinnet/tss-lib/releases/tag/v2.0.0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://medium.com/@iofinnet/security-disclosure-for-ecdsa-and-eddsa-threshold-signature-schemes-4e969af7155b"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-294"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-05T19:42:25Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-04-21T18:15:07Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
