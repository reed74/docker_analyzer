It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could reach the system.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch has been implemented by [commit `14042aa`](https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/commit/14042aa66a577caee777e10fe09adcf2587d20dd) and shipped in [`v0.1.4`](https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/releases/tag/v0.1.4).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround exist.\n\n### References\n\nN/A.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.1.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-r7fm-3pqm-ww5w/GHSA-r7fm-3pqm-ww5w.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/security/advisories/GHSA-r7fm-3pqm-ww5w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53633"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/commit/14042aa66a577caee777e10fe09adcf2587d20dd"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/releases/tag/v0.1.4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-405","CWE-409"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-10T17:50:25Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-10T20:15:27Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
