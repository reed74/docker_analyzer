By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"25.0.0+incompatible"},{"fixed":"25.0.5+incompatible"},{"introduced":"26.0.0-rc1+incompatible"},{"fixed":"26.0.0-rc3+incompatible"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://vuln.go.dev/ID/GO-2024-2659.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46609"}],"database_specific":{"review_status":"REVIEWED","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2659"},"credits":[{"name":"@robmry"},{"name":"@akerouanton"},{"name":"@neersighted"},{"name":"@gabriellavengeo"}]}
