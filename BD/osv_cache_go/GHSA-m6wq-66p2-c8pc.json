Because protobuf fields are optional, unmarshalling succeeds but leaves `BlockHash` as nil. Babylon then dereferences this nil pointer in consensus-critical code paths (notably `VerifyVoteExtension`, and also proposal-time vote verification), causing a runtime panic.\n\n### Impact\n\nIntermittent validator crashes at epoch boundaries, which would slow down the creation of the epoch boundary block.\n\n### Finder \n\nVulnerability discovered by:\n\n- @GrumpyLaurie55348","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/v4","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/v4"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/v3","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/v3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3.0.0-snapshot.250805a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/security/advisories/GHSA-m6wq-66p2-c8pc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/commit/f79ad58c1d5bcab3451cb7a47c91e713935917d7"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-08T22:20:24Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
