The order in which objects are deleted during namespace termination is not defined, and it is possible for network policies to be deleted before the pods that they protect. This can lead to a brief period in which the pods are running, but network policies that should apply to connections to and from the pods are not enforced.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-apiserver","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-apiserver"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.3.0"},{"last_affected":"1.32.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-r56h-j38w-hrqq/GHSA-r56h-j38w-hrqq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7598"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126587"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/67D7UFqiPRc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/20/2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-362"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-21T17:44:11Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-20T17:15:37Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
