{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-fh55-q5pj-pxgw","published":"2025-08-26T15:27:25Z","modified":"2025-11-03T21:54:13.245408Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-55212"],"summary":"ImageMagick affected by divide-by-zero in ThumbnailImage via montage -geometry \":\" leads to crash","details":"## Summary\nPassing a geometry string containing only a colon (\":\") to montage -geometry leads GetGeometry() to set width/height to 0. Later, ThumbnailImage() divides by these zero dimensions, triggering a crash (SIGFPE/abort), resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Details\n**Root Cause**\n1. `montage -geometry \":\" ...` reaches `MagickCore/geometry.c:GetGeometry().`\n2. `StringToDouble/InterpretLocaleValue` parses `\":\"` as `0.0;` then: \nhttps://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/0ba1b587be17543b664f7ad538e9e51e0da59d17/MagickCore/geometry.c#L355\n`WidthValue` (and/or `HeightValue)` is set with a zero dimension.\n3. In MagickCore/resize.c:ThumbnailImage(), the code computes:\nhttps://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/0ba1b587be17543b664f7ad538e9e51e0da59d17/MagickCore/resize.c#L4625-L4629\ncausing a division by zero and immediate crash.\n\nThe issue is trivially triggerable without external input files (e.g., using `xc:white`).\n\n### Reproduction\nEnvironment\n```\nVersion: ImageMagick 7.1.2-1 (Beta) Q16-HDRI x86_64 0ba1b587b:20250812 https://imagemagick.org\nFeatures: Cipher DPC HDRI\nDelegates (built-in): bzlib fontconfig freetype jbig jng jpeg lcms lzma pangocairo png tiff x xml zlib\nCompiler: clang (14.0.0)\nOS/Arch: Linux x86_64\n```\nSteps\n```\n./bin/magick montage -geometry : xc:white null:\n```\nObserved result\n```\nIOT instruction (core dumped)\n# (Environment-dependent: SIGFPE/abort may be observed.)\n```\n\n## PoC\nNo external file required; the pseudo image xc:white suffices:\n```\n./bin/magick montage -geometry : xc:white null:\n```\n\n## Impact\n- **Denial of Service:** A divide-by-zero in `ThumbnailImage()` causes immediate abnormal termination (e.g., SIGFPE/abort), crashing the ImageMagick process.\n\n\n## Suggested fix\nDefensively reject zero dimensions early in `ThumbnailImage()`:\n```c\nif ((columns == 0) || (rows == 0)) {\n  (void) ThrowMagickException(exception, GetMagickModule(), OptionError,\n    \"InvalidGeometry\", \"thumbnail requires non-zero dimensions: %.20gx%.20g\",\n    (double) columns, (double) rows);\n  return (Image *) NULL;\n}\n```\nAdditionally, consider tightening validation in `GetGeometry()` so that colon-only (and similar malformed) inputs do not yield `WidthValue/HeightValue` with zero, or are rejected outright. Variants like `\"x:\"` or `\":x\"` may also need explicit handling (maintainer confirmation requested).\n\n## Credits\n### Team Daemon Fuzz Hunters\n**Bug Hunting Master Program,
