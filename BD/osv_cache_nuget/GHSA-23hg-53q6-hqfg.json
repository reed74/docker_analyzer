The subsequent [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938) then expands by **`quantum + length`** (amortized) instead of **`offset + length`**, and copies to `data + offset`. When `offset ≫ extent`, the copy targets memory beyond the allocation, producing a deterministic heap write on 64-bit builds. No 2⁶⁴ arithmetic wrap, external delegates, or policy settings are required.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Scope\n\n- **Versions confirmed:** 7.1.2-0, 7.1.2-1\n    \n- **Architectures:** Observed on macOS arm64; architecture-agnostic on LP64\n    \n- Paths: MagickCore blob subsystem — **BlobStream** ([`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) and [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938)).\n    \n- **Not required:** External delegates; special policies; integer wraparound\n    \n\n---\n\n## Technical Root Cause\n\n**Types (LP64):**  \n`offset: MagickOffsetType` (signed 64-bit)  \n`extent/length/quantum: size_t` (unsigned 64-bit)  \n`data: unsigned char*`\n\n**Contract mismatch:**\n\n- [`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) (BlobStream) updates `offset` to arbitrary positions, including past end, **without** capacity adjustment.\n    \n- [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938) tests `offset + length >= extent` and grows **by** `length + quantum`, doubles `quantum`, reallocates to `extent + 1`, then:\n    \n    ```\n    q = data + (size_t)offset;\n    memmove(q, src, length);\n    ```\n    \n    There is **no guarantee** that `extent ≥ offset + length` post-growth. With `offset ≫ extent`, `q` is beyond the allocation.\n    \n\n**Wrap-free demonstration:**  \nInitialize `extent=1`, write one byte (`offset=1`), seek to `0x10000000` (256 MiB), then write 3–4 bytes. Growth remains << `offset + length`; the copy overruns the heap buffer.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitability & Reachability\n\n- **Primitive:** Controlled bytes written at a controlled displacement from the buffer base.\n    \n- **Reachability:** Any encode-to-memory flow that forward-seeks prior to writing (e.g., header back-patching, reserved-space strategies). Even if current encoders/writers avoid this, the API contract **permits** it, thus creating a latent sink for first- or third-party encoders/writers.\n    \n- **Determinism:** Once a forward seek past end occurs, the first subsequent write reliably corrupts memory.\n    \n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\n- **Integrity:** High - adjacent object/metadata overwrite plausible.\n    \n- **Availability:** High - reliably crashable (ASan and non-ASan).\n    \n- **Confidentiality:** High - Successful exploitation to RCE allows the attacker to read all data accessible by the compromised process.\n    \n- **RCE plausibility:** Typical of heap OOB writes in long-lived image services; allocator/layout dependent.\n    \n\n---\n\n## CVSS v3.1 Rationale (9.8)\n\n- **AV:N / PR:N / UI:N** - server-side image processing is commonly network-reachable without auth or user action.\n    \n- **AC:L** - a single forward seek + write suffices; no races or specialized state.\n    \n- **S:U** - corruption localized to the ImageMagick process.\n    \n- **C:H / I:H / A:H** - A successful exploit leads to RCE, granting full control over the process. This results in a total loss of Confidentiality (reading sensitive data), Integrity (modifying files/data), and Availability (terminating the service).\n    \n\n_Base scoring assumes successful exploitation; environmental mitigations are out of scope of Base metrics._\n\n---\n\n## Violated Invariant\n\n> **Before copying `length` bytes at `offset`, enforce `extent ≥ offset + length` with overflow-checked arithmetic.**\n\nThe BlobStream growth policy preserves amortized efficiency but fails to enforce this **per-write** safety invariant.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation (Principle)\n\nIn [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938) (BlobStream case):\n\n1. **Checked requirement:**  \n    `need = (size_t)offset + length;` → if `need < (size_t)offset`, overflow → fail.\n    \n2. **Ensure capacity ≥ need:**  \n    `target = MagickMax(extent + quantum + length, need);`  \n    (Optionally loop, doubling `quantum`, until `extent ≥ need` to preserve amortization.)\n    \n3. **Reallocate to `target + 1` before copying;** then perform the move.\n    \n\n**Companion hardening (recommended):**\n\n- Document or restrict [`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) on BlobStream so forward seeks either trigger explicit growth/zero-fill or require the subsequent write to meet the invariant.\n    \n- Centralize blob arithmetic in checked helpers.\n    \n- Unit tests: forward-seek-then-write (success and overflow-reject).\n    \n\n---\n\n## Regression & Compatibility\n\n- **Behavior change:** Forward-seeked writes will either allocate to required size or fail cleanly (overflow/alloc-fail).\n    \n- **Memory profile:** Single writes after very large seeks may allocate large buffers; callers requiring sparse behavior should use file-backed streams.\n    \n\n---\n\n## Vendor Verification Checklist\n\n- Reproduce with a minimal in-memory BlobStream harness under ASan.\n    \n- Apply fix; verify `extent ≥ offset + length` at all write sites.\n    \n- Add forward-seek test cases (positive/negative).\n    \n- Audit other growth sites (`SetBlobExtent`, stream helpers).\n    \n- Clarify BlobStream seek semantics in documentation.\n    \n- Unit test: forward seek to large offset on **BlobStream** followed by 1–8 byte writes; assert either growth to `need` or clean failure.\n    \n\n---\n\n# PoC / Reproduction / Notes\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OS/Arch:** macOS 14 (arm64)\n
