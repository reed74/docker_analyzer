As such it's possible for a user without a valid API key to retrieve a response for a given path and query if it has recently been requested and cached by request with a valid key.\n\n### Patches\nPatches will be available in 13.9.3, 15.4.4 and 16.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nWorkaround is to remove or reduce the time period of the output caching or to provide other restrictions to access the delivery API such as by IP.\n\n### References\nContent delivery API documentation: https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/content-delivery-api","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"13.0.0"},{"fixed":"13.9.3"}]}],"versions":["13.0.0","13.0.1","13.0.2","13.0.3","13.1.0","13.1.0-rc","13.1.1","13.2.0","13.2.0-rc","13.2.1","13.2.2","13.3.0","13.3.0-rc","13.3.1","13.3.2","13.4.0","13.4.0-rc","13.4.0-rc2","13.4.1","13.5.0","13.5.0-rc","13.5.1","13.5.2","13.5.3","13.6.0","13.6.0-rc","13.6.0-rc2","13.7.0","13.7.0-rc","13.7.1","13.7.2","13.8.0","13.8.0-rc","13.8.1","13.9.0","13.9.0-rc","13.9.1","13.9.2"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 13.9.2","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"15.0.0"},{"fixed":"15.4.4"}]}],"versions":["15.0.0","15.1.0","15.1.0-rc","15.1.0-rc2","15.1.1","15.1.2","15.2.0","15.2.0-rc","15.2.1","15.2.2","15.2.3","15.3.0","15.3.0-rc","15.3.0-rc2","15.3.1","15.4.0","15.4.0-rc","15.4.0-rc2","15.4.1","15.4.2","15.4.3"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 15.4.3","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Umbraco.Cms.Api.Delivery"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"16.0.0"},{"fixed":"16.1.1"}]}],"versions":["16.0.0","16.1.0","16.1.0-rc"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 16.1.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-75vq-qvhr-7ffr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54425"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/commit/7e82c258eebaa595eadc9b000461e27d02bc030e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/commit/9f37db18d11c8ba4e3ecdeb35291af30ebee7cd0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/commit/da43086017e1e318f6b5373391d78421efebce3a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/content-delivery-api"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-29T19:10:39Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-30T14:15:29Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
