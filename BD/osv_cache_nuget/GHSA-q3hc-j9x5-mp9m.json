{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m","published":"2025-12-03T16:25:15Z","modified":"2025-12-11T21:03:56.469223Z","withdrawn":"2025-12-11T20:53:33Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-65955"],"summary":"Withdrawn Advisory: ImageMagick has a use-after-free/double-free risk in Options::fontFamily when clearing family","details":"## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it does not affect the ImageMagick project's NuGet packages.\n\n### Original Description\nWe believe that we have discovered a potential security vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when `Options::fontFamily` is invoked with an empty string.\n\n**Vulnerability Details**\n- Clearing a font family calls `RelinquishMagickMemory` on `_drawInfo->font`, freeing the font string but leaving `_drawInfo->font` pointing to freed memory while `_drawInfo->family` is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of `_drawInfo->font` re-frees or dereferences dangling memory.\n- `DestroyDrawInfo` and other setters (`Options::font`, `Image::font`) assume `_drawInfo->font` remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.\n\n```cpp\nif (family_.length() == 0)\n  {\n    _drawInfo->family=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo->font);\n    DestroyString(RemoveImageOption(imageInfo(),\"family\"));\n  }\n```\n\n- **CWE-416 (Use After Free):** `_drawInfo->font` is left dangling yet still reachable through the Options object.\n- **CWE-415 (Double Free):** DrawInfo teardown frees `_drawInfo->font` again, provoking allocator aborts.\n\n**Affected Versions**\n- Introduced by commit `6409f34d637a34a1c643632aa849371ec8b3b5a8` (“Added fontFamily to the Image class of Magick++”, 2015-08-01, blame line 313).\n- Present in all releases that include that commit, at least ImageMagick 7.0.1-0 and later (likely late 6.9 builds with Magick++ font family support as well). Older releases without `fontFamily` are unaffected.\n\n**Command Line Triggerability**\nThis vulnerability cannot be triggered from the command line interface. The bug is specific to the Magick++ C++ API, specifically the `Options::fontFamily()` method. The command-line utilities (such as `convert`, `magick`, etc.) do not expose this particular code path, as they operate through different internal mechanisms that do not directly call `Options::fontFamily()` with an empty string in a way that would trigger the use-after-free condition.\n\n**Proposed Fix**\n```diff\ndiff --git a/Magick++/lib/Options.cpp b/Magick++/lib/Options.cpp\n@@ void Magick::Options::fontFamily(const std::string &family_)\n-      _drawInfo->family=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo->font);\n+      _drawInfo->family=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo->family);\n```\nThis frees only the actual family string, leaving `_drawInfo->font` untouched. Optionally nulling `_drawInfo->font` when clearing `font()` itself maintains allocator hygiene.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Magick.NET-Q16-AnyCPU","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Magick.NET-Q16-AnyCPU"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"14.9.1"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0","10.1.0","11.0.0","11.1.0","11.1.1","11.1.2","11.2.0","11.2.1","11.3.0","12.0.0","12.0.1","12.1.0","12.2.0","12.2.1","12.2.2","12.3.0","13.0.0","13.0.1","13.1.0","13.1.1","13.1.2","13.1.3","13.10.0","13.2.0","13.3.0","13.4.0","13.5.0","13.6.0","13.7.0","13.8.0","13.9.0","13.9.1","14.0.0","14.1.0","14.2.0","14.3.0","14.4.0","14.5.0","14.6.0","14.7.0","14.8.0","14.8.1","14.8.2","14.9.0","14.9.1","6.8.8.1001","6.8.9.1","6.8.9.101","6.8.9.2","6.8.9.401","6.8.9.501","6.8.9.601","7.0.0.1","7.0.0.10","7.0.0.101","7.0.0.102","7.0.0.103","7.0.0.104","7.0.0.11","7.0.0.12","7.0.0.13","7.0.0.14","7.0.0.15","7.0.0.16","7.0.0.17","7.0.0.18","7.0.0.19","7.0.0.2","7.0.0.20","7.0.0.21","7.0.0.22","7.0.0.3","7.0.0.4","7.0.0.5","7.0.0.6","7.0.0.7","7.0.0.8","7.0.0.9","7.0.1","7.0.1.100","7.0.1.101","7.0.1.500","7.0.2.100","7.0.2.400","7.0.2.600","7.0.2.900","7.0.2.901","7.0.2.902","7.0.3","7.0.3.1","7.0.3.300","7.0.3.500","7.0.3.501","7.0.3.502","7.0.3.901","7.0.3.902","7.0.4.100","7.0.4.400","7.0.4.700","7.0.4.701","7.0.5.500","7.0.5.501","7.0.5.502","7.0.5.800","7.0.5.900","7.0.6","7.0.6.100","7.0.6.1000","7.0.6.1001","7.0.6.1002","7.0.6.101","7.0.6.102","7.0.6.600","7.0.6.601","7.0.7","7.0.7.300","7.0.7.700","7.0.7.900","7.1.0","7.10.0","7.10.1","7.10.2","7.11.0","7.11.1","7.12.0","7.13.0","7.13.1","7.14.0","7.14.0.1","7.14.0.2","7.14.0.3","7.14.1","7.14.2","7.14.3","7.14.4","7.14.5","7.15.0","7.15.0.1","7.15.1","7.15.2","7.15.3","7.15.4","7.15.5","7.16.0","7.16.1","7.17.0","7.17.0.1","7.18.0","7.19.0","7.19.0.1","7.2.0","7.2.1","7.20.0","7.20.0.1","7.21.0","7.21.1","7.22.0","7.22.1","7.22.2","7.22.2.1","7.22.2.2","7.22.3","7.23.0","7.23.1","7.23.2","7.23.2.1","7.23.3","7.23.4","7.24.0","7.24.1","7.3.0","7.4.0","7.4.1","7.4.2","7.4.3","7.4.4","7.4.5","7.4.6","7.5.0","7.5.0.1","7.6.0","7.6.0.1","7.7.0","7.8.0","7.9.0","7.9.0.1","7.9.0.2","7.9.1","7.9.2","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.4.0","8.5.0","8.6.0","8.6.1","9.0.0","9.1.0","9.1.1","9.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m/GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Magick.NET-Q16-HDRI-AnyCPU","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Magick.NET-Q16-HDRI-AnyCPU"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"14.9.1"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0","10.1.0","11.0.0","11.1.0","11.1.1","11.1.2","11.2.0","11.2.1","11.3.0","12.0.0","12.0.1","12.1.0","12.2.0","12.2.1","12.2.2","12.3.0","13.0.0","13.0.1","13.1.0","13.1.1","13.1.2","13.1.3","13.10.0","13.2.0","13.3.0","13.4.0","13.5.0","13.6.0","13.7.0","13.8.0","13.9.0","13.9.1","14.0.0","14.1.0","14.2.0","14.3.0","14.4.0","14.5.0","14.6.0","14.7.0","14.8.0","14.8.1","14.8.2","14.9.0","14.9.1","6.8.9.101","6.8.9.401","6.8.9.501","6.8.9.601","7.0.0.1","7.0.0.10","7.0.0.101","7.0.0.102","7.0.0.103","7.0.0.104","7.0.0.11","7.0.0.12","7.0.0.13","7.0.0.14","7.0.0.15","7.0.0.16","7.0.0.17","7.0.0.18","7.0.0.19","7.0.0.2","7.0.0.20","7.0.0.21","7.0.0.22","7.0.0.3","7.0.0.4","7.0.0.5","7.0.0.6","7.0.0.7","7.0.0.8","7.0.0.9","7.0.1","7.0.1.100","7.0.1.101","7.0.1.500","7.0.2.100","7.0.2.400","7.0.2.600","7.0.2.900","7.0.2.901","7.0.2.902","7.0.3","7.0.3.1","7.0.3.300","7.0.3.500","7.0.3.501","7.0.3.502","7.0.3.901","7.0.3.902","7.0.4.100","7.0.4.400","7.0.4.700","7.0.4.701","7.0.5.500","7.0.5.501","7.0.5.502","7.0.5.800","7.0.5.900","7.0.6","7.0.6.100","7.0.6.1000","7.0.6.1001","7.0.6.1002","7.0.6.101","7.0.6.102","7.0.6.600","7.0.6.601","7.0.7","7.0.7.300","7.0.7.700","7.0.7.900","7.1.0","7.10.0","7.10.1","7.10.2","7.11.0","7.11.1","7.12.0","7.13.0","7.13.1","7.14.0","7.14.0.1","7.14.0.2","7.14.0.3","7.14.1","7.14.2","7.14.3","7.14.4","7.14.5","7.15.0","7.15.0.1","7.15.1","7.15.2","7.15.3","7.15.4","7.15.5","7.16.0","7.16.1","7.17.0","7.17.0.1","7.18.0","7.19.0","7.19.0.1","7.2.0","7.2.1","7.20.0","7.20.0.1","7.21.0","7.21.1","7.22.0","7.22.1","7.22.2","7.22.2.1","7.22.2.2","7.22.3","7.23.0","7.23.1","7.23.2","7.23.2.1","7.23.3","7.23.4","7.24.0","7.24.1","7.3.0","7.4.0","7.4.1","7.4.2","7.4.3","7.4.4","7.4.5","7.4.6","7.5.0","7.5.0.1","7.6.0","7.6.0.1","7.7.0","7.8.0","7.9.0","7.9.0.1","7.9.0.2","7.9.1","7.9.2","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.4.0","8.5.0","8.6.0","8.6.1","9.0.0","9.1.0","9.1.1","9.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m/GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Magick.NET-Q16-HDRI-OpenMP-arm64","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Magick.NET-Q16-HDRI-OpenMP-arm64"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"14.9.1"}]}],"versio
