From the CVE:\n\n> This was not a security issue in Bootstrap. Bootstrap’s JavaScript is not intended to sanitize unsafe or intentionally dangerous HTML. As such, the reported behavior fell outside the scope of Bootstrap’s security model, and the associated CVE has been rescinded.\n\n## Original Description\nA vulnerability has been identified in Bootstrap that exposes users to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The issue is present in the carousel component, where the `data-slide` and `data-slide-to` attributes can be exploited through the href attribute of an `<a>` tag due to inadequate sanitization. This vulnerability could potentially enable attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's browser.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bootstrap","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bootstrap","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bootstrap","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"versions":["2.3.1","2.3.2","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.6-jQuery3","3.3.6.1","3.3.7","3.4.0","3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bootstrap-sass","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/bootstrap-sass"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.3.1","2.0.4.0","2.0.4.1","2.0.4.2","2.1.0.0","2.1.0.1","2.1.1.0","2.2.1.0","2.2.1.1","2.2.2.0","2.3.0.0","2.3.0.1","2.3.1.0","2.3.1.2","2.3.1.3","2.3.2.0","2.3.2.1","2.3.2.2","3.0.0.0","3.0.0.0.rc","3.0.0.0.rc2","3.0.1.0","3.0.1.0.rc","3.0.2.0","3.0.2.1","3.0.3.0","3.1.0.0","3.1.0.1","3.1.0.2","3.1.1.0","3.1.1.1","3.2.0.4","3.3.0.0","3.3.0.1","3.3.1.0","3.3.2.0","3.3.2.1","3.3.3","3.3.4.1","3.3.5","3.3.5.1","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.4.0","3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bootstrap.sass","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/bootstrap.sass"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"versions":["3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"twbs/bootstrap","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/twbs/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"versions":["v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc.2","v3.0.0-rc1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.6","v3.3.7","v3.4.0","v3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.webjars:bootstrap","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.webjars/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"versions":["2.0.2","2.1.1","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.2-1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.1-1","2.3.2","3.0.0","3.0.0-rc.2","3.0.0-rc1","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.1-1","3.1.1-2","3.2.0","3.2.0-1","3.2.0-2","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.2-1","3.3.2-2","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.7-1","3.4.0","3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.webjars.npm:bootstrap","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.webjars.npm/bootstrap"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.1"}]}],"versions":["3.1.1","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.4.0","3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bootstrap-sass","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/bootstrap-sass"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"last_affected":"3.4.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2/GHSA-9mvj-f7w8-pvh2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6484"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/bootstrap-sass/CVE-2024-6484.yml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/bootstrap/CVE-2024-6484.yml"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.herodevs.com/vulnerability-directory/cve-2024-6484"}],"database_specific":{
