Malicious input, even if sanitized for display elsewhere, can be executed when processed through certain commands, leading to potential script execution (XSS).\n\n# Description\nThe application sanitizes most user-submitted data before displaying it in entry forms. However, the Prompt module is capable of running commands whose output is treated as HTML. This creates a vulnerability where a malicious user can craft input containing embedded scripts or harmful markup.\n\nIf such malicious content is later processed by a Prompt command and returned as HTML, it bypasses the standard sanitation mechanisms. Simply executing a specific command through the Prompt module could render this untrusted data and cause unintended script execution in the browser specially in the context of a super-user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"DotNetNuke.Core","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/DotNetNuke.Core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.1.0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0","10.0.1","6.0.0","7.0.0","7.0.6.121","7.1.0","7.1.2","7.2.0.613","7.3.0.499","7.3.1.20","7.4.0.353","7.4.1.280","7.4.2.216","8.0.0.809","8.0.1.239","8.0.2.4","8.0.3.5","8.0.4.226","9.0.0.1002","9.0.1.142","9.1.0.367","9.1.1.129","9.10.0","9.10.1","9.10.2","9.11.0","9.11.1","9.11.2","9.12.0","9.13.0","9.13.0-ci0000","9.13.1","9.13.2","9.13.3","9.13.4","9.13.5","9.13.5-ci0062","9.13.6","9.13.7","9.13.7-ci0064","9.13.8","9.13.9","9.2.0.366","9.2.1.533","9.3.0","9.3.1","9.3.2","9.4.0","9.4.1","9.4.2","9.4.3","9.4.4","9.5.0","9.6.1","9.6.2","9.7.0","9.7.1","9.7.2","9.8.0","9.9.0","9.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-2qxc-mf4x-wr29/GHSA-2qxc-mf4x-wr29.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2qxc-mf4x-wr29"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59545"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-23T15:09:19Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-23T18:15:38Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
