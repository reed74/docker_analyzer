When this patch is applied the Server closes all channels using the Basic128Rsa15 if an attack is detected. This introduces a DoS before any compromise can occur which is preferable to a compromise. To prevent this failure, applications must stop using Basic128Rsa15.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"OPCFoundation.NetStandard.Opc.Ua.Core","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/OPCFoundation.NetStandard.Opc.Ua.Core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.374.158"}]}],"versions":["0.0.3","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","1.4.363.104-preview","1.4.363.107","1.4.364.40","1.4.365-gfc341ee8c5","1.4.365.1-preview","1.4.365.10","1.4.365.2","1.4.365.23","1.4.365.48","1.4.366.31-preview","1.4.366.38","1.4.367.100","1.4.367.39","1.4.367.41","1.4.367.42","1.4.367.64-preview","1.4.367.75","1.4.367.95","1.4.368.27-preview","1.4.368.33","1.4.368.52-preview","1.4.368.53","1.4.368.58","1.4.369.30","1.4.370.1","1.4.370.12","1.4.370.9","1.4.371.41","1.4.371.50","1.4.371.60","1.4.371.86","1.4.371.91","1.4.371.96","1.4.372.106","1.4.372.107","1.4.372.112-preview","1.4.372.116-preview","1.4.372.38-preview","1.4.372.46-preview","1.4.372.56","1.4.372.67-preview","1.4.372.76","1.4.372.91-preview","1.5.368.2-rc0","1.5.368.3-rc0","1.5.368.5-beta","1.5.371.3-beta","1.5.372.1-rc","1.5.372.110-rc2","1.5.372.113","1.5.373.121","1.5.373.3-preview","1.5.374.118","1.5.374.124","1.5.374.126","1.5.374.26-preview","1.5.374.27","1.5.374.33-preview","1.5.374.36","1.5.374.50-preview","1.5.374.54","1.5.374.61-preview","1.5.374.70","1.5.374.78"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-h958-fxgg-g7w3/GHSA-h958-fxgg-g7w3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard/security/advisories/GHSA-h958-fxgg-g7w3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42512"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard/commit/3543d0292556691f681e39145e2de4526b90487d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://files.opcfoundation.org/SecurityBulletins/OPC%20Foundation%20Security%20Bulletin%20CVE-2024-42512.pdf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-208","CWE-639"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-03T20:10:59Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
