This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their environments to remove this vulnerability.\n\nA vulnerability exists in .NET where predictable paths for MSBuild's temporary directories on Linux let another user create the directories ahead of MSBuild, leading to DoS of builds. This only affects .NET on Linux operating systems.\n\n## Announcement\n\nAnnouncement for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/370\n\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\n\nProjects which do not utilize the [DownloadFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/downloadfile-task)  build task are not susceptible to this vulnerability.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\n\n* Any installation of .NET 10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107 SDK or earlier.\n* Any installation of .NET 9.0.110 SDK, .NET 9.0.305 SDK or earlier.\n* Any installation of .NET 8.0.120 SDK, .NET 8.0.317 SDK, .NET 8.0.414 SDK or earlier.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected Packages\n\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected packages versions listed below\n\nPackage name |Affected version | Patched version\n------------ |---------------- | -------------------------\n[Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core) | 17.15.0-preview-25277-114 <br />>=17.14.0, <= 17.14.8 <br />>= 17.12.0, <= 17.12.36 <br/> >= 17.11.0, <= 17.11.31<br />  >= 17.10.0, <= 17.10.29 <br />  >= 17.8.0, <= 17.8.29 <br /> | 18.0.0-preview-25476-107 <br />17.14.28 <br />17.12.50 <br/>17.11.48 <br />17.10.46 <br />17.8.43 <br />\n\n\nPackage name|Affected version | Patched version\n------------ |---------------|----------------\n[Microsoft.Build](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build) | 17.15.0-preview-25277-114 <br />>=17.14.0, <= 17.14.8 <br />>= 17.12.0, <= 17.12.36 <br/> >= 17.11.0, <= 17.11.31<br />  >= 17.10.0, <= 17.10.29 <br />  >= 17.8.0, <= 17.8.29 <br /> | 18.0.0-preview-25476-107 <br />17.14.28 <br />17.12.50 <br/>17.11.48 <br />17.10.46 <br />17.8.43 <br />\n\nPackage name  |Affected version | Patched version\n------------ |---------------|----------------\n[Microsoft.Build.Utilities.core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core/17.15.0-preview-25277-114)| 17.15.0-preview-25277-114 <br />>=17.14.0, <= 17.14.8 <br />>= 17.12.0, <= 17.12.36 <br/> >= 17.11.0, <= 17.11.31<br />  >= 17.10.0, <= 17.10.29 <br />  >= 17.8.0, <= 17.8.29 <br /> | 18.0.0-preview-25476-107 <br />17.14.28 <br />17.12.50 <br/>17.11.48 <br />17.10.46 <br />17.8.43 <br />\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a .NET SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 10.0 SDK, .NET 9.0 SDK or .NET 8.0 SDK. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 10.0, you should download and install the appropriate SDK: `.NET 10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107` for Visual Studio 2026 v18 Preview 3.
