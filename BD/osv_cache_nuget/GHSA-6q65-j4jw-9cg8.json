The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the filesystem accessible by the web application (i.e. appsettings.json or other files containing secrets).\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug is patched in versions  **4.2.10**, **4.3.8** and **5.0.0-preview03-final** (and newer).\n\nApart from updating DotVVM, it is also recommend invalidating any secrets which could have been leaked by an application deployed in Debug mode (such as database passwords).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot update to a patched version, avoid running a publicly accessible DotVVM application in Debug mode (Development environment in Asp.Net Core). It is recommend adding the following statement to the DotvvmStartup class:\n\n```\n    config.Debug = false; // TODO: workaround for GHSA-6q65-j4jw-9cg8, remove after updating DotVVM\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"DotVVM","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/DotVVM"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.3.0-preview01-final"},{"fixed":"4.3.8"}]}],"versions":["4.3.0","4.3.0-preview01-final","4.3.0-preview02-final","4.3.0-preview03-final","4.3.0-preview04-final","4.3.0-preview05-final","4.3.0-preview06-final","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.3.7"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<=
