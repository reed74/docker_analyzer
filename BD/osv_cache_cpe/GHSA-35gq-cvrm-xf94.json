An authorized user with read access to the provenance events of those processors may see the credentials information. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.3.0 is the recommended mitigation, which removes the credentials from provenance event records.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.nifi:nifi-mongodb-services","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.nifi/nifi-mongodb-services"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.13.0"},{"fixed":"2.3.0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.0","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14.0","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.16.0","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.17.0","1.18.0","1.19.0","1.19.1","1.20.0","1.21.0","1.22.0","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.23.2","1.24.0","1.25.0","1.26.0","1.27.0","1.28.0","1.28.1","2.0.0","2.0.0-M1","2.0.0-M2","2.0.0-M3","2.0.0-M4","2.1.0","2.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-35gq-cvrm-xf94/GHSA-35gq-cvrm-xf94.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27017"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/48d684500f6ad70f65bfd510db054590c5bc74a9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14272"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/d4n5474jkhp82dvnht13pjtlfx7bhn5q"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/11/1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-538"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-12T22:08:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-12T17:15:50Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N/S:P/AU:Y/R:U/V:C/RE:L/U:Green"}]}
