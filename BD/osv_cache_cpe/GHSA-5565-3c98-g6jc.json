When using the elytron-oidc-client subsystem with WildFly, authorization code injection attacks can occur, allowing an attacker to inject a stolen authorization code into the attacker's own session with the client with a victim's identity. This is usually done with a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or phishing attack.\n\n### Patches\n\n[2.2.9.Final](https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/releases/tag/2.2.9.Final)\n[2.6.2.Final](https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/releases/tag/2.6.2.Final)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nCurrently, no mitigation is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12369\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12369\t\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2331178\nhttps://issues.redhat.com/browse/ELY-2887","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.wildfly.security:wildfly-elytron","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.wildfly.security/wildfly-elytron"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.17.0.Final"},{"fixed":"2.2.9.Final"}]}],"versions":["1.17.0.Final","1.17.1.Final","1.17.2.Final","1.17.3.Final","1.18.0.Final","1.18.1.Final","1.18.2.Final","1.18.3.Final","1.19.0.Final","1.19.1.Final","1.20.0.Final","1.20.1.Final","1.20.2.Final","1.20.3.Final","1.20.4.Final","2.0.0.Alpha1","2.0.0.Alpha10","2.0.0.Alpha2","2.0.0.Alpha3","2.0.0.Alpha4","2.0.0.Alpha5","2.0.0.Alpha6","2.0.0.Alpha7","2.0.0.Alpha8","2.0.0.Alpha9","2.0.0.Beta1","2.0.0.Beta2","2.0.0.Beta3","2.0.0.Final","2.1.0.Final","2.2.0.Final","2.2.1.Final","2.2.2.Final","2.2.3.Final","2.2.4.Final","2.2.5.Final","2.2.6.Final","2.2.7.Final","2.2.8.Final"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.wildfly.security:wildfly-elytron","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.wildfly.security/wildfly-elytron"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.3.0.Final"},{"fixed":"2.6.2.Final"}]}],"versions":["2.3.0.Final","2.3.1.Final","2.4.0.CR1","2.4.0.Final","2.4.1.Final","2.4.2.Final","2.5.0.CR1","2.5.0.Final","2.5.1.Final","2.5.2.Final","2.6.0.Final","2.6.1.Final"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.wildfly.security:wildfly-elytron-http-oidc","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.wildfly.security/wildfly-elytron-http-oidc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.17.0.Final"},{"fixed":"2.2.9.Final"}]}],"versions":["1.17.0.Final","1.17.1.Final","1.17.2.Final","1.17.3.Final","1.18.0.Final","1.18.1.Final","1.18.2.Final","1.18.3.Final","1.19.0.Final","1.19.1.Final","1.20.0.Final","1.20.1.Final","1.20.2.Final","1.20.3.Final","1.20.4.Final","2.0.0.Beta1","2.0.0.Beta2","2.0.0.Beta3","2.0.0.Final","2.1.0.Final","2.2.0.Final","2.2.1.Final","2.2.2.Final","2.2.3.Final","2.2.4.Final","2.2.5.Final","2.2.6.Final","2.2.7.Final","2.2.8.Final"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.wildfly.security:wildfly-elytron-http-oidc","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.wildfly.security/wildfly-elytron-http-oidc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.3.0.Final"},{"fixed":"2.6.2.Final"}]}],"versions":["2.3.0.Final","2.3.1.Final","2.4.0.CR1","2.4.0.Final","2.4.1.Final","2.4.2.Final","2.5.0.CR1","2.5.0.Final","2.5.1.Final","2.5.2.Final","2.6.0.Final","2.6.1.Final"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/security/advisories/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12369"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/pull/2253"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/pull/2261"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/commit/5ac5e6bbcba58883b3cebb2ddbcec4de140c5ceb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/commit/d7754f5a6a91ceb0f4dbbbfe301991f6a55404cb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12369"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2331178"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ELY-2887"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-345"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-25T21:49:11Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
