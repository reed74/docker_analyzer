When endpoint identification is enabled in the BCJSSE and an SSL socket is created without an explicit hostname (as happens with HttpsURLConnection), hostname verification could be performed against a DNS-resolved IP address in some situations, opening up a possibility of DNS poisoning.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk18on"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.61"},{"fixed":"1.78"}]}],"versions":["1.71","1.71.1","1.72","1.73","1.74","1.75","1.76","1.77"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15to18","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15to18"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.61"},{"fixed":"1.78"}]}],"versions":["1.63","1.64","1.65","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70","1.71","1.72","1.73","1.74","1.75","1.76","1.77"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk14","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk14"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.61"},{"fixed":"1.78"}]}],"versions":["1.61","1.62","1.63","1.64","1.65","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70","1.71","1.72","1.73","1.74","1.75","1.76","1.77"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk12","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk12"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.61"},{"fixed":"1.78"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.bouncycastle:bctls-fips","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bctls-fips"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.19"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.10.1","1.0.10.2","1.0.10.3","1.0.11","1.0.11.1","1.0.11.2","1.0.11.3","1.0.11.4","1.0.12","1.0.12.1","1.0.12.2","1.0.12.3","1.0.13","1.0.14","1.0.14.1","1.0.16","1.0.17","1.0.18","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.bouncycastle:bcprov-lts8on","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-lts8on"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.73.6"}]}],"versions":["2.73.0","2.73.1","2.73.2","2.73.3","2.73.4","2.73.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w/GHSA-4h8f-2wvx-gg5w.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34447"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/1656"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9034447"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240614-0007"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-297"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-03T20:34:32Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-05-03T16:15:11Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
