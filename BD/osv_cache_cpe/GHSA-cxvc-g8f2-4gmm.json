Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.22.2. JCR lookup through JNDI has been disabled by default in 2.22.2. Users of this feature need to enable it explicitly and are adviced to review their use of JNDI URI for JCR lookup.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.jackrabbit/jackrabbit-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.22.2"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.0.1","1.1","1.1.1","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3","1.3.1","1.3.3","1.4","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","1.5.0","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.7","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.4","1.6.5","2.0-beta1","2.0-beta3","2.0-beta4","2.0-beta5","2.0-beta6","2.0.0","2.0.3","2.0.5","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.4","2.10.5","2.10.6","2.10.7","2.10.8","2.10.9","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.11.3","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.12.10","2.12.11","2.12.2","2.12.3","2.12.4","2.12.5","2.12.6","2.12.7","2.12.8","2.12.9","2.13.0","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.13.4","2.13.5","2.13.6","2.13.7","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.14.10","2.14.2","2.14.3","2.14.4","2.14.5","2.14.6","2.14.7","2.14.8","2.14.9","2.15.0","2.15.1","2.15.2","2.15.3","2.15.4","2.15.5","2.15.6","2.15.7","2.15.8","2.16.0","2.16.1","2.16.10","2.16.2","2.16.3","2.16.4","2.16.5","2.16.6","2.16.7","2.16.8","2.16.9","2.17.0","2.17.1","2.17.2","2.17.3","2.17.4","2.17.5","2.17.6","2.17.7","2.18.0","2.18.1","2.18.2","2.18.3","2.18.4","2.18.5","2.18.6","2.19.0","2.19.1","2.19.2","2.19.3","2.19.4","2.19.5","2.19.6","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.10","2.2.11","2.2.12","2.2.13","2.2.2","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.2.7","2.2.8","2.2.9","2.20.0","2.20.1","2.20.10","2.20.11","2.20.12","2.20.13","2.20.14","2.20.15","2.20.16","2.20.17","2.20.2","2.20.3","2.20.4","2.20.5","2.20.6","2.20.7","2.20.8","2.20.9","2.21.0","2.21.1","2.21.10","2.21.11","2.21.12","2.21.13","2.21.14","2.21.15","2.21.16","2.21.17","2.21.18","2.21.19","2.21.2","2.21.20","2.21.21","2.21.22","2.21.23","2.21.24","2.21.25","2.21.26-beta","2.21.27-beta","2.21.3","2.21.4","2.21.5","2.21.6","2.21.7","2.21.8","2.21.9","2.22.0","2.22.1","2.3.0","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.10","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.8.10","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.6","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.8.9","2.9.0","2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-cxvc-g8f2-4gmm/GHSA-cxvc-g8f2-4gmm.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit-jcr-commons","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.jackrabbit/jackrabbit-jcr-commons"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.22.2"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.0.1","1.1","1.1.1","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3","1.3.1","1.3.3","1.4","1.4.2","1.5.0","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.5","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.4","1.6.5","2.0-beta1","2.0-beta3","2.0-beta4","2.0-beta5","2.0-beta6","2.0.0","2.0.3","2.0.5","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.4","2.10.5","2.10.6","2.10.7","2.10.8","2.10.9","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.11.3","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.12.10","2.12.11","2.12.2","2.12.3","2.12.4","2.12.5","2.12.6","2.12.7","2.12.8","2.12.9","2.13.0","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.13.4","2.13.5","2.13.6","2.13.7","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.14.10","2.14.2","2.14.3","2.14.4","2.14.5","2.14.6","2.14.7","2.14.8","2.14.9","2.15.0","2.15.1","2.15.2","2.15.3","2.15.4","2.15.5","2.15.6","2.15.7","2.15.8","2.16.0","2.16.1","2.16.10","2.16.2","2.16.3","2.16.4","2.16.5","2.16.6","2.16.7","2.16.8","2.16.9","2.17.0","2.17.1","2.17.2","2.17.3","2.17.4","2.17.5","2.17.6","2.17.7","2.18.0","2.18.1","2.18.2","2.18.3","2.18.4","2.18.5","2.18.6","2.19.0","2.19.1","2.19.2","2.19.3","2.19.4","2.19.5","2.19.6","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.10","2.2.11","2.2.12","2.2.13","2.2.2","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.2.7","2.2.8","2.2.9","2.20.0","2.20.1","2.20.10","2.20.11","2.20.12","2.20.13","2.20.14","2.20.15","2.20.16","2.20.17","2.20.2","2.20.3","2.20.4","2.20.5","2.20.6","2.20.7","2.20.8","2.20.9","2.21.0","2.21.1","2.21.10","2.21.11","2.21.12","2.21.13","2.21.14","2.21.15","2.21.16","2.21.17","2.21.18","2.21.19","2.21.2","2.21.20","2.21.21","2.21.22","2.21.23","2.21.24","2.21.25","2.21.26-beta","2.21.27-beta","2.21.3","2.21.4","2.21.5","2.21.6","2.21.7","2.21.8","2.21.9","2.22.0","2.22.1","2.3.0","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.10","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.8.10","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.6","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.8.9","2.9.0","2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GH
