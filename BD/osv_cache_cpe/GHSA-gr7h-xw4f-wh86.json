An attacker who can obtain ciphertexts (e.g., exported or at‑rest strings protected by this service) and approximate the PRNG seed can feasibly reconstruct the serverSecretKey and decrypt affected data.\n\n### Patches\nSAK-49866 is patched in Sakai 23.5, 25.0, and trunk. \n\n### Credits\n- Reported by [Suraj Gangwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surajgangwar?trk=contact-info).\n- Patched by Sam Ottenhoff (Longsight).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.sakaiproject.kernel:sakai-kernel-impl","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.sakaiproject.kernel/sakai-kernel-impl"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"23.3"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0","1.3.0-b03","1.3.0-b04","1.3.0-b06","1.3.0-b07","1.3.0-rc01","1.3.0-rc02","1.3.0-rc03","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","10.3","10.4","10.6","10.7","11.0","11.1","11.2","11.3","11.4","12.0","12.1","12.2","12.3","12.4","12.5","12.6","12.7","19.0","19.1","19.2","19.3","19.4","19.5","19.6","20.0","20.1","20.2","20.3","20.4","20.5","20.6","21.0","21.1","21.2","21.3","21.4","21.5","22.0","22.1","22.2","22.3","22.4","22.5","23.0","23.1","23.2","23.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-gr7h-xw4f-wh86/GHSA-gr7h-xw4f-wh86.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/security/advisories/GHSA-gr7h-xw4f-wh86"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62710"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/commit/bde070104b1de01f4a6458dca6d9e0880a0e3c04"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-337"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-22T19:41:49Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-22T23:15:34Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
