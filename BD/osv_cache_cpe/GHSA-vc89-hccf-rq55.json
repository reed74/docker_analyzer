{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-vc89-hccf-rq55","published":"2022-01-06T23:48:35Z","modified":"2025-12-16T22:56:31.776825Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-21653"],"summary":"Hash collision in typelevel jawn","details":"### Impact\n\nExtenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision attack.  Most applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library:\n\nAffected implementations include:\n* `org.http4s` :: `http4s-play-json`\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-ast` (< 0.8.0)\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-play` (discontinued)\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-rojoma` (discontinued)\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-spray` (discontinued)\n\nUnaffected implementations include:\n* `io.argonaut :: argonaut-jawn`\n* `io.circe :: circe-parser`\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-ast` (>= 0.8.0)\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-json4s` (discontinued)\n* `org.typelevel :: jawn-argonaut` (discontinued)\n\n### Patches\n\n`jawn-parser-1.3.2` fixes the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOverride `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection.  See [the patch](https://github.com/typelevel/jawn/pull/390/files) for an example in both `SimpleFacade` and `MutableFacade`.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/typelevel/jawn/pull/390\n\n### Credits\n\n* @kag0, for the report and the patch\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in
