(\"generic\" model is not impacted)\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property \"org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES\" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.parquet:parquet-avro","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.parquet/parquet-avro"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.2"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0","1.10.1","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-53wx-pr6q-m3j5/GHSA-53wx-pr6q-m3j5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46762"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/parquet-java"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-3985"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/t7724lpvl110xsbgqwsmrdsns0rhycdp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/02/1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-73"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-06T16:46:15Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-06T10:15:16Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:H/SA:H/S:N/RE:M/U:Amber"}]}
