This allows a malicious attacker, once obtained access to the internal database content, to reconstruct the original cleartext password values.\nThis is not affecting encrypted plain attributes, whose values are also stored using AES encryption.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.15 / 4.0.3, which fix this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.syncope:syncope-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.syncope/syncope-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.0.3"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-jqg8-m35q-jh7j/GHSA-jqg8-m35q-jh7j.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.syncope:syncope-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.syncope/syncope-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.15"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-RC1-incubating","1.0.0-RC2-incubating","1.0.0-RC3-incubating","1.0.0-incubating","1.0.1-incubating","1.0.2-incubating","1.0.3-incubating","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7","1.1.8","1.2.0","1.2.0-M1","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","2.0.0","2.0.0-M1","2.0.0-M2","2.0.0-M3","2.0.0-M4","2.0.0.M5","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.12","2.0.13","2.0.14","2.0.15","2.0.16","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.12","2.1.13","2.1.14","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","3.0.0","3.0.0-M0","3.0.0-M1","3.0.0-M2","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.11","3.0.12","3.0.13","3.0.14","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-jqg8-m35q-jh7j/GHSA-jqg8-m35q-jh7j.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65998"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope/commit/297498ebfc86e4996f5e3e4ef7b7f8b1cd82004b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope/commit/9d706af25d2e60327b8b5b63186f9da51ed79a1d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/fjh0tb0d1xkbphc5ogdsc348ppz88cts"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/24/1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-321"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-25T14:14:13Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-24T14:15:48Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
