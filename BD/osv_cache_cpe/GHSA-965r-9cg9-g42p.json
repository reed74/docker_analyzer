Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.ritense.valtimo:objecten-api","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.ritense.valtimo/objecten-api"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"11.0.0.RELEASE"},{"last_affected":"11.3.3.RELEASE"}]}],"versions":["11.0.0.RELEASE","11.1.0.RELEASE","11.1.1.RELEASE","11.1.2.RELEASE","11.1.4.RELEASE","11.1.5.RELEASE","11.1.6.RELEASE","11.2.0.RELEASE","11.2.1.RELEASE","11.2.2.RELEASE","11.3.0.RELEASE","11.3.1.RELEASE","11.3.2.RELEASE","11.3.3.RELEASE"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p.json"}},{"package":{"name":"com.ritense.valtimo:object-management","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.ritense.valtimo/object-management"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"11.0.0.RELEASE"},{"last_affected":"11.3.3.RELEASE"}]}],"versions":["11.0.0.RELEASE","11.1.0.RELEASE","11.1.1.RELEASE","11.1.2.RELEASE","11.1.4.RELEASE","11.1.5.RELEASE","11.1.6.RELEASE","11.2.0.RELEASE","11.2.1.RELEASE","11.2.2.RELEASE","11.3.0.RELEASE","11.3.1.RELEASE","11.3.2.RELEASE","11.3.3.RELEASE"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p.json"}},{"package":{"name":"com.ritense.valtimo:object-management","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.ritense.valtimo/object-management"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"12.0.0.RELEASE"},{"fixed":"12.13.0.RELEASE"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0.RELEASE","12.0.1.RELEASE","12.1.0.RELEASE","12.1.1.RELEASE","12.1.2.RELEASE","12.1.3.RELEASE","12.10.0.RELEASE","12.10.1.RELEASE","12.10.2.RELEASE","12.11.0.RELEASE","12.12.0.RELEASE","12.2.0.RELEASE","12.2.1.RELEASE","12.3.0.RELEASE","12.3.1.RELEASE","12.4.0.RELEASE","12.4.1.RELEASE","12.5.0.RELEASE","12.5.1.RELEASE","12.6.0.RELEASE","12.6.1.1.RC","12.6.1.RELEASE","12.7.0.RELEASE","12.7.1.RELEASE","12.7.2.RELEASE","12.7.3.RELEASE","12.8.0.RELEASE","12.9.0.RELEASE"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p.json"}},{"package":{"name":"com.ritense.valtimo:objecten-api","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.ritense.valtimo/objecten-api"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"12.0.0.RELEASE"},{"fixed":"12.13.0.RELEASE"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0.RELEASE","12.0.1.RELEASE","12.1.0.RELEASE","12.1.1.RELEASE","12.1.2.RELEASE","12.1.3.RELEASE","12.10.0.RELEASE","12.10.1.RELEASE","12.10.2.RELEASE","12.11.0.RELEASE","12.12.0.RELEASE","12.2.0.RELEASE","12.2.1.RELEASE","12.3.0.RELEASE","12.3.1.RELEASE","12.4.0.RELEASE","12.4.1.RELEASE","12.5.0.RELEASE","12.5.1.RELEASE","12.6.0.RELEASE","12.6.1.1.RC","12.6.1.RELEASE","12.7.0.RELEASE","12.7.1.RELEASE","12.7.2.RELEASE","12.7.3.RELEASE","12.8.0.RELEASE","12.9.0.RELEASE"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48881"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/6ab04b30d3dab816bfea32d40ba50e5dd4517272"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-28T14:38:54Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-30T06:15:28Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
