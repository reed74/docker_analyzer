Incorrect error handling for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a memory leak. A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a denial of service.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.90 though 8.5.100.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix
