This could allow attackers access to files within another folder which starts with the same path. For example, the default UI config directory is placed at `/etc/opencast/ui-config`. Without this patch, an attacker can get access to files in a folder `/etc/opencast/ui-config-hidden` if those files are readable by Opencast.\n\nGeneral path traversal is not possible. For example, an attacker **cannot** exploit this to access files in `/etc/opencast/encoding` or even in `/etc/opencast/` directly.\n\n### How dangerous is this?\n\nTheoretically, this vulnerability may be exploited to get access to some non-public files. However, given the default structure of Opencast's configuration, this is extremely unlikely to hit any users. There can be but one `ui-config` folders. This makes it quite unlikely for any user to have created an additional folder starting with `ui-config`. Users could also rename this folder, but since there is no real reason for anyone to do this, this, again is extremely unlikely to trigger this issue.\n\n### How to fix the issue\n\n- To mitigate this, check if you have folders which start with the same path as your `ui-config` folder\n- A fix is available in https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/6979\n- Updating to Opencast 17.7 or 18.1 will fix the issue","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.opencastproject:opencast-user-interface-configuration","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-user-interface-configuration"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"17.7"}]}],"versions":["10.0","10.1","10.10","10.11","10.12","10.2","10.3","10.4","10.5","10.6","10.7","10.8","10.9","11.0","11.1","11.10","11.11","11.2","11.3","11.4","11.5","11.6","11.7","11.8","11.9","12.0","12.1","12.11","12.12","12.13","12.2","12.3","12.5","12.6","12.7","12.8","12.9","13.0","13.1","13.10","13.11","13.12","13.2","13.4","13.5","13.6","13.7","13.8","14.0","14.1","14.10","14.11","14.12","14.13","14.2","14.3","14.5","14.6","14.7","14.8","14.9","15.0","15.1","15.10","15.11","15.12","15.13","15.2","15.3","15.4","15.5","15.6","15.7","15.8","15.9","16.0","16.1","16.10","16.2","16.3","16.4","16.5","16.6","16.7","16.8","16.9","7.2","7.3","7.4","7.5","7.6","7.7","7.8","7.9","8.0","8.1","8.10","8.11","8.3","8.4","8.5","8.6","8.7","8.8","8.9","9.0","9.1","9.10","9.11","9.12","9.2","9.3","9.4","9.5","9.6","9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-hq8m-v68g-8cf8/GHSA-hq8m-v68g-8cf8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.opencastproject:opencast-user-interface-configuration","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-user-interface-configuration"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"18.0"},{"fixed":"18.1"}]}],"versions":["18.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-hq8m-v68g-8cf8/GHSA-hq8m-v68g-8cf8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-hq8m-v68g-8cf8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55202"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/6979"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/e2cc65d6fbe052ebb71d9f6b583bb54b181af009"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-23"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-29T15:34:37Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-29T16:15:36Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
