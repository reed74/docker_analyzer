In strToObject function ,it's trying to deserialize value when value starts with \"b64~\" , which might cause deserialization of untrusted data.\n\n[modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/pac4j/SessionStoreImpl.java](https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/blob/v3.6.1/modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/pac4j/SessionStoreImpl.java#L77-L84)\n\nHere's a small demo using SessionStoreImpl#get to handle sessions ,and user can pass parameters.\n\n![屏幕截图 2025-03-25 051325](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93039a06-d4f1-458a-8595-736b3fede345)\n\nAnd following below is exploiting successfully(execute calculator)\n\n![屏幕截图 2025-03-24 015128（1）](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/415cf20c-dda0-4634-83ae-f8fa89677a16)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"io.jooby:jooby-pac4j","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/io.jooby/jooby-pac4j"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.17.0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0","2.11.0","2.12.0","2.13.0","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.14.2","2.15.0","2.15.1","2.16.0","2.16.1","2.16.2","2.16.3","2.16.4","2.4.0","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.8.10","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.6","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.8.9","2.9.0","2.9.1","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","2.9.5","2.9.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7c5v-895v-w4q5/GHSA-7c5v-895v-w4q5.json"}},{"package":{"name":"io.jooby:jooby-pac4j","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/io.jooby/jooby-pac4j"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0.M1"},{"fixed":"3.7.0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.0.M1","3.0.0.M11","3.0.0.M2","3.0.0.M3","3.0.0.M4","3.0.0.M5","3.0.0.M6","3.0.0.M7","3.0.0.M9","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.2.8","3.2.9","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5","3.6.0","3.6.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7c5v-895v-w4q5/GHSA-7c5v-895v-w4q5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/security/advisories/GHSA-7c5v-895v-w4q5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31129"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/commit/3e13562cf36d7407813eae464e0f4b598de15692"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/blob/v2.x/modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/pac4j/SessionStoreImpl.java#L39-L45"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/blob/v3.6.1/modules/jooby-pac4j/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/pac4j/SessionStoreImpl.java#L77-L84"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-01T14:19:43Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-31T19:15:43Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
