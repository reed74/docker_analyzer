An unauthenticated remote attacker can repeatedly initiate TLS renegotiation requests to exhaust server CPU resources, making the service unavailable. Immediate mitigation is available by setting the `-Djdk.tls.rejectClientInitiatedRenegotiation=true` Java system property in the Keycloak startup configuration.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-dist","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-dist"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"26.0.16"}]}],"versions":["17.0.0","17.0.1","18.0.0","18.0.1","18.0.2","19.0.0","19.0.1","19.0.2","19.0.3","20.0.0","20.0.1","20.0.2","20.0.3","20.0.5","21.0.0","21.0.1","21.0.2","21.1.0","21.1.1","21.1.2","22.0.0","22.0.1","22.0.2","22.0.3","22.0.4","22.0.5","23.0.0","23.0.1","23.0.2","23.0.3","23.0.4","23.0.5","23.0.6","23.0.7","24.0.0","24.0.1","24.0.2","24.0.3","24.0.4","24.0.5","25.0.0","25.0.1","25.0.2","25.0.3","25.0.4","25.0.5","25.0.6","26.0.0","26.0.1","26.0.2","26.0.4","26.0.5","26.0.6","26.0.7","26.0.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-dist","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-dist"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"26.1.0"},{"fixed":"26.2.10"}]}],"versions":["26.1.0","26.1.1","26.1.2","26.1.3","26.1.4","26.1.5","26.2.0","26.2.1","26.2.2","26.2.3","26.2.4","26.2.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-dist","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-dist"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"26.3.0"},{"fixed":"26.4.1"}]}],"versions":["26.3.0","26.3.1","26.3.2","26.3.3","26.3.4","26.3.5","26.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-q8hq-4h99-fj7x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11419"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:18254"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:18255"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:18889"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:18890"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-11419"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2402142"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-27T20:46:54Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-23T21:15:46Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
