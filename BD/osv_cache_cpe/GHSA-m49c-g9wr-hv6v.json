However, these protections can be bypassed.\n\nBy using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(), it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals.\n\nAs a result, an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL, opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining, this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\n### Details\n\njinjava templates expose a built-in variable `____int3rpr3t3r____`, which provides direct access to the jinjavaInterpreter instance.\nThis variable was previously abused and protections were added to prevent call method from `JinjavaInterpreter` instances (see [Add interpreter to blacklist](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/commit/1b9aaa4b420c58b4a301cf4b7d26207f1c8d1165)).\nHowever, interacting with the properties of `JinjavaInterpreter` instances remains [unrestricted](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/blob/jinjava-2.8.0/src/main/java/com/hubspot/jinjava/el/ext/JinjavaBeanELResolver.java#L80-L84).\n\nFrom `____int3rpr3t3r____`, it is possible to traverse to the `config` field, which exposes an ObjectMapper. By invoking `readValue(String content, JavaType valueType)` on this ObjectMapper, an attacker can instantiate arbitrary classes specified via `JavaType`.\n\nAlthough jinjava explicitly restricts dangerous classes such as `Class`, `ClassLoader`, and so on inside `JinjavaBeanELResolver`, the `JavaType` class itself is [not restricted](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/blob/jinjava-2.8.0/src/main/java/com/hubspot/jinjava/el/ext/JinjavaBeanELResolver.java#L246-L262). \n\nAs a result, an attacker can leverage `JavaType` construction (`constructFromCanonical`) to instantiate semi-arbitrary classes without directly calling restricted methods.\n\nThis allows sandbox escape and the creation of powerful primitives. \n\n### Impact\nEscape the Jinjava sandbox and instantiate a wide range of classes using JavaType.\nThis capability can be used to read arbitrary files and to perform full read SSRF by creating network-related objects.\nIn certain environments, depending on the available classes, this primitive can even lead to complete remote code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.hubspot.jinjava:jinjava","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.hubspot.jinjava/jinjava"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.8.0"},{"fixed":"2.8.1"}]}],"versions":["2.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v.json"}},{"package":{"name":"com.hubspot.jinjava:jinjava","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.hubspot.jinjava/jinjava"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7.5"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11-java7","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.12","2.1.13","2.1.14","2.1.15","2.1.16","2.1.17","2.1.18","2.1.19","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.10","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.2.6","2.2.7","2.2.8","2.2.9","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.10","2.4.11","2.4.12","2.4.13","2.4.14","2.4.15","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.4.9","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.10","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.5.6","2.5.7","2.5.8","2.5.9","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/security/advisories/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59340"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/commit/66df351e7e8ad71ca04dcacb4b65782af820b8b1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/releases/tag/jinjava-2.7.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/releases/tag/jinjava-2.8.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-17T19:56:21Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-17T20:15:36Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
