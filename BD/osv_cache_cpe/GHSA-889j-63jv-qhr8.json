The Jetty HTTP/2 server does not perform validation on this setting, and tries to allocate a ByteBuffer of the specified capacity to encode HTTP responses, likely resulting in OutOfMemoryError being thrown, or even the JVM process exiting.\n\n### Impact\nRemote peers can cause the JVM to crash or continuously report OOM.\n\n### Patches\n12.0.17\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/12690","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.eclipse.jetty.http2:jetty-http2-common","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.eclipse.jetty.http2/jetty-http2-common"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"12.0.0"},{"fixed":"12.0.17"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0","12.0.1","12.0.10","12.0.11","12.0.12","12.0.13","12.0.14","12.0.15","12.0.16","12.0.2","12.0.3","12.0.4","12.0.5","12.0.6","12.0.7","12.0.8","12.0.9"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 12.0.16","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-889j-63jv-qhr8/GHSA-889j-63jv-qhr8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-889j-63jv-qhr8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1948"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/12690"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/commit/c8c2515936ef968dc8a3cecd9e79d1e69291e4bb"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/56"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-08T19:28:45Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-08T18:15:41Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
