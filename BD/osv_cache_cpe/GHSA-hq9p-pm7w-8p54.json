This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept connections that users believed were protected by channel binding requirements.\n\n### Patches\nTBD\n\n### Workarounds\n\nConfigure `sslMode=verify-full` to prevent MITM attacks.\n\n### References\n\n* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sasl-authentication.html#SASL-SCRAM-SHA-256\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7677\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.postgresql:postgresql","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.postgresql/postgresql"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"42.7.4"},{"fixed":"42.7.7"}]}],"versions":["42.7.4","42.7.5","42.7.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-hq9p-pm7w-8p54/GHSA-hq9p-pm7w-8p54.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-hq9p-pm7w-8p54"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49146"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9217ed16cb2918ab1b6b9258ae97e6ede244d8a0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7677"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sasl-authentication.html#SASL-SCRAM-SHA-256"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-11T14:44:04Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-11T15:15:42Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
