{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-rpx3-f938-xj5q","published":"2025-09-24T03:30:26Z","modified":"2025-12-17T00:09:20.555536Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-43819"],"summary":"Liferay Portal and DXP does not properly expire sessions","details":"### Summary\n\nLiferay Portal/DXP contains an Insufficient Session Expiration issue where the Single Logout (SLO) API may fail to invalidate a user’s previous session. An attacker can reuse a stale session via the SLO endpoint to gain an authenticated context.\n\n### Affected Versions\n\nThe following platform versions are affected:\n\n*   **Liferay Portal:**  \n    *   `7.3.3.131` through `7.4.3.121`\n*   **Liferay DXP:**\n    *   `2024.Q4.0`–`2024.Q4.3`\n    *   `2024.Q3.1`–`2024.Q3.13`\n    *   `2024.Q2.0`–`2024.Q2.13`\n    *   `2024.Q1.1`–`2024.Q1.12`\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpdate to the fixed builds and, for Maven consumers of the SAML module, upgrade `com.liferay:com.liferay.saml.impl` to **5.0.51** or later. After upgrading, ensure session invalidation policies are enforced and verify SLO behavior end-to-end.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.liferay:com.liferay.saml.impl","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.liferay/com.liferay.saml.impl"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.0.51"}]}],"versions":["1.0.21","1.0.22","1.0.23","1.0.24","1.0.25","1.0.26","1.0.27","1.0.28","1.0.29","2.0.21","2.0.22","2.0.23","2.0.24","2.0.25","2.0.26","2.0.27","2.0.28","2.0.29","2.0.30","2.0.31","2.0.32","2.0.33","2.0.34","2.0.35","2.0.36","2.0.37","2.0.38","3.0.22","3.0.23","3.0.24","3.0.25","3.0.26","3.0.27","3.0.28","3.0.29","3.0.30","3.0.31","3.0.32","3.0.33","3.0.34","3.0.35","3.0.36","3.0.37","4.0.15","4.0.16","4.0.17","4.0.18","4.0.19","4.0.20","4.0.21","4.0.22","4.0.23","4.0.24","4.0.25","4.0.26","4.0.27","4.0.28","4.0.29","4.0.30","4.0.31","4.0.32","4.0.33","4.0.34","4.0.35","4.0.36","4.0.37","4.0.38","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.10","5.0.11","5.0.12","5.0.13","5.0.14","5.0.15","5.0.16","5.0.17","5.0.18","5.0.19","5.0.2","5.0.20","5.0.21","5.0.22","5.0.23","5.0.24","5.0.25","5.0.26","5.0.27","5.0.28","5.0.29","5.0.3","5.0.30","5.0.31","5.0.32","5.0.33","5.0.34","5.0.35","5.0.36","5.0.37","5.0.38","5.0.39","5.0.4","5.0.40","5.0.41","5.0.42","5.0.43","5.0.44","5.0.45","5.0.46","5.0.47","5.0.48","5.0.49","5.0.5","5.0.50","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-rpx3-f938-xj5q/GHSA-rpx3-f938-xj5q.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43819"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/433dff5edae4414fdc436b49a9edb62d721c84b5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/da9105a61d788801797797a32583a4b76c902cdc"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LPE-18159"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://liferay.dev/portal/security/known-vulnerabilities/-/asset_publisher/jekt/content/CVE-2025-43819"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-rpx3-f938-xj5q"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-613"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-24T17:28:45Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-24T02:15:31Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
