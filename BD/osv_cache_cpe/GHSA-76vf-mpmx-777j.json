Additionally, an active Input must be present on the Graylog server that is capable of receiving form data (e.g. a HTTP input, TCP raw or syslog etc).\n\n### Patches\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, as long as the relatively rare prerequisites are met.\n\nAnalysis provided by Fabian Yamaguchi - Whirly Labs (Pty) Ltd","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.graylog2:graylog2-server","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.graylog2/graylog2-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.14"}]}],"versions":["0.20.0-rc.1-1","0.21.0-beta2","0.21.0-beta3","0.21.0-beta4","0.21.0-rc.1","0.90.0","0.90.1","0.90.3","0.91.0-rc.1","0.91.1","0.91.3","0.92.0","0.92.0-beta.1","0.92.0-rc.1","0.92.1","0.92.1-rc.1","0.92.2","0.92.3","0.92.4","1.0.0","1.0.0-beta.1","1.0.0-beta.2","1.0.0-beta.3","1.0.0-rc.1","1.0.0-rc.2","1.0.0-rc.3","1.0.0-rc.4","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.1.0","1.1.0-beta.1","1.1.0-beta.2","1.1.0-beta.3","1.1.0-rc.1","1.1.0-rc.2","1.1.0-rc.3","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.2.0","1.2.0-rc.1","1.2.0-rc.2","1.2.0-rc.3","1.2.0-rc.4","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.3.0","1.3.0-beta.1","1.3.0-beta.2","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","2.0.0","2.0.0-alpha.1","2.0.0-alpha.2","2.0.0-alpha.3","2.0.0-alpha.4","2.0.0-alpha.5","2.0.0-beta.1","2.0.0-beta.2","2.0.0-beta.3","2.0.0-rc.1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.1.0","2.1.0-alpha.1","2.1.0-alpha.2","2.1.0-beta.1","2.1.0-beta.2","2.1.0-beta.3","2.1.0-beta.4","2.1.0-rc.1","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.2.0","2.2.0-alpha.1","2.2.0-alpha.2","2.2.0-alpha.3","2.2.0-alpha.4","2.2.0-beta.1","2.2.0-beta.2","2.2.0-beta.3","2.2.0-beta.4","2.2.0-beta.5","2.2.0-beta.6","2.2.0-rc.1","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3.0","2.3.0-alpha.1","2.3.0-alpha.2","2.3.0-alpha.3","2.3.0-beta.1","2.3.0-rc.1","2.3.0-rc.2","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4.0","2.4.0-alpha.1","2.4.0-alpha.2","2.4.0-alpha.3","2.4.0-beta.1","2.4.0-beta.2","2.4.0-beta.3","2.4.0-beta.4","2.4.0-rc.1","2.4.0-rc.2","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.5.0","2.5.0-alpha.1","2.5.0-beta.1","2.5.1","2.5.2","3.0.0","3.0.0-alpha.0","3.0.0-alpha.1","3.0.0-alpha.2","3.0.0-alpha.3","3.0.0-alpha.4","3.0.0-alpha.5","3.0.0-beta.1","3.0.0-beta.2","3.0.0-beta.3","3.0.0-beta.4","3.0.0-rc.1","3.0.0-rc.2","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta.2","3.1.0-beta.3","3.1.0-rc.1","3.1.0-rc.2","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.3.0","3.3.0-beta.3","3.3.0-rc.1","3.3.10","3.3.11","3.3.12","3.3.13","3.3.14","3.3.15","3.3.17","3.3.2","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.8","3.3.9","4.0.0","4.0.0-beta.4","4.0.0-rc.1","4.0.0-rc.2","4.0.1","4.0.10","4.0.11","4.0.12","4.0.13","4.0.14","4.0.16","4.0.17","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.0.7","4.0.8","4.0.9","4.1.0","4.1.0-beta.1","4.1.0-beta.2","4.1.0-rc.1","4.1.1","4.1.11","4.1.12","4.1.13","4.1.14","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.1.4","4.1.5","4.1.6","4.1.7","4.1.8","4.1.9","4.2.0","4.2.0-beta.1","4.2.0-rc.1","4.2.1","4.2.10","4.2.11","4.2.12","4.2.13","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.7","4.2.8","4.2.9","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.10","4.3.11","4.3.12","4.3.13","4.3.14","4.3.15","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.3.7","4.3.8","4.3.9","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.10","5.0.11","5.0.12","5.0.13","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.0.9","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.1.10","5.1.11","5.1.12","5.1.13","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.1.6","5.1.7","5.1.8","5.1.9","5.2.0","5.2.0-alpha.1","5.2.0-beta.1","5.2.0-beta.2","5.2.0-beta.3","5.2.0-rc.1","5.2.0-rc.2","5.2.1","5.2.10","5.2.11","5.2.12","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.2.6","5.2.7","5.2.8","5.2.9","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.10","6.0.11","6.0.12","6.0.13","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.0.8","6.0.9"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 6.0.13","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-76vf-mpmx-777j/GHSA-76vf-mpmx-777j.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.graylog2:graylog2-server","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.graylog2/graylog2-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.10"}]}],"versions":["6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.1.6","6.1.7","6.1.8"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 6.1.9","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-76vf-mpmx-777j/GHSA-76vf-mpmx-777j.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/security/advisories/GHSA-76vf-mpmx-777j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46827"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-07T15:27:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-07T16:15:22Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
