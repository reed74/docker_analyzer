This JSON file allows users to customize claims returned by the \"id_token\" and \"user_info\" files.\nThis allows for a very wide range of vulnerabilities depending on how clients use claims. For example, if some clients rely on an email field to identify a user, users can choose to entera any email address, and therefore assume any chosen identity.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.openidentityplatform.openam:openam-oauth2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openidentityplatform.openam/openam-oauth2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"16.0.3"}]}],"versions":["14.5.2","14.5.3","14.5.4","14.6.1","14.6.2","14.6.3","14.6.4","14.6.5","14.6.6","14.7.0","14.7.1","14.7.2","14.7.3","14.7.4","14.8.1","14.8.2","14.8.3","14.8.4","15.0.0","15.0.1","15.0.2","15.0.3","15.0.4","15.1.0","15.1.1","15.1.2","15.1.3","15.1.4","15.1.5","15.1.6","15.2.0","15.2.1","15.2.2","16.0.1","16.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-39hr-239p-fhqc/GHSA-39hr-239p-fhqc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/security/advisories/GHSA-39hr-239p-fhqc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64099"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/commit/4254b34b2b8b4867f2e7fccfac73904213d48510"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/releases/tag/16.0.3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74","CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-12T21:27:22Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-12T19:15:38Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
