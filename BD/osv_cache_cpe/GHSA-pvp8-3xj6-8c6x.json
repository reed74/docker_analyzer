The Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenarios where you only load trusted configurations. \n\nUsers that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement, but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package namespace they can be loaded side-by-side, making it possible to do a gradual migration.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"commons-configuration:commons-configuration","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/commons-configuration/commons-configuration"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.10"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.0-dev-2.20021231.045254","1.0-dev-3.20030603.101200","1.0-dev-3.20030607.194155","1.0-rc1","1.0-rc2","1.1","1.10","1.2","1.2RC1","1.2RC2","1.3","1.4","1.5","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-pvp8-3xj6-8c6x/GHSA-pvp8-3xj6-8c6x.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46392"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/commons-configuration"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/y1pl0mn3opz6kwkm873zshjdxq3dwq5s"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29131"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29133"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-09T15:54:59Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-09T10:15:17Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
