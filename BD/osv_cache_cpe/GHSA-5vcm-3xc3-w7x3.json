Rendering is optional per spec.\n* If a header name is invalid in a request or response, the header is dropped.  There is no way to generically sanitize a header without potentially shadowing a correct one.\n* If a header value is invalid in a request or response, it is sanitized by replacing null (`\\u0000`), carriage return (`\\r`), and newline (`\\n`) with space (` `) characters per spec.\n* If a URI path or registered name is invalid in a request line, the client raises an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n* If a URI registered name is invalid in a host header, the client raises an `IllegalArgumentException`. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nhttp4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend.  The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\nNot all backends were affected: jetty-server, tomcat-server, armeria, and netty on the server; async-http-client, okhttp-client, armeria, and netty as clients.\n\n### References\n* https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting\n*
