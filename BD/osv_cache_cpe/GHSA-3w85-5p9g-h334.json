When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.\n\nThis issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:artemis-server","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/artemis-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.40.0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.1.0","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.11.0","2.12.0","2.13.0","2.14.0","2.15.0","2.16.0","2.17.0","2.18.0","2.19.0","2.19.1","2.2.0","2.20.0","2.21.0","2.22.0","2.23.0","2.23.1","2.24.0","2.25.0","2.26.0","2.27.0","2.27.1","2.28.0","2.29.0","2.3.0","2.30.0","2.31.0","2.31.1","2.31.2","2.32.0","2.33.0","2.34.0","2.35.0","2.36.0","2.37.0","2.38.0","2.39.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-3w85-5p9g-h334/GHSA-3w85-5p9g-h334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27427"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/2216a75a57f098295abb283d556c8b8bda91324d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/6ab458015689303db8878941abe1bc973299fc2e"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-5346"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/8dzlm2vkqphyrnkrby8r8kzndsm5o6x8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/31/1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-01T18:04:06Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-01T08:15:13Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
