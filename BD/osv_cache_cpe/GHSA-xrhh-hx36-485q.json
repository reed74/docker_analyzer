{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-xrhh-hx36-485q","published":"2025-12-05T22:02:37Z","modified":"2025-12-05T22:32:40.472758Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-66623"],"summary":"Strimzi allows unrestricted access to all Secrets in the same Kubernetes namespace from Kafka Connect and MirrorMaker 2 operands","details":"### Impact\n\nIn some situations, Strimzi creates an incorrect Kubernetes `Role` which grants the Apache Kafka Connect and Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 operands the `GET` access to all Kubernetes Secrets that exist in the given Kubernetes namespace. The exact scenario when this happens is when:\n* Apache Kafka Connect is deployed without at least one of the following options configured:\n    * TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates (no `.spec.tls.trustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n    * mTLS authentication (no `type: tls` in `.spec.authentication` section of the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n    * TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates for `type: oauth` authentication (no `.spec.authentication.tlsTrustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n* Apache Kafka MirrorMaker2 is deployed without at least one of the following options configured for the target cluster:\n    * TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates (no `.spec.target.tls.trustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n    * mTLS authentication (no `type: tls` in `.spec.target.authentication` section of the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n    * TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates for `type: oauth` authentication (no `.spec.target.authentication.tlsTrustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n    * TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates (no `.spec.clusters[].tls.trustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR for the target cluster)\n    * mTLS authentication (no `type: tls` in `.spec.clusters[].authentication` section of the `KafkaConnect` CR for the target cluster)\n    * TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates for `type: oauth` authentication (no `.spec.clusters[].authentication.tlsTrustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR for the target cluster)\n\nWhen the operands configured as described above are deployed with Strimzi >= 0.47.0 and <= 0.49.0, any code running within their Pods and using their Service Account for authentication will be able to `GET` any Kubernetes Secret from the same namespace. This can be done by executing 3rd party tools from the Pods. Or directly from the Kafka Connect code, for example, using configuration providers or HTTP connectors. The Pods are allowed to only `GET` the Secrets. They are not allowed to list, watch, modify, or delete the Secrets.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in Strimzi 0.49.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for this issue when using the affected operands with the affected configurations.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"io.strimzi:strimzi","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/io.strimzi/strimzi"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0.47.0"},{"fixed":"0.49.1"}]}],"versions":["0.47.0","0.48.0","0.48.0-RC1","0.49.0","0.49.0-RC1","0.49.0-RC2","0.49.1-RC1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-xrhh-hx36-485q/GHSA-xrhh-hx36-485q.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-xrhh-hx36-485q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66623"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/c8a14935e99c91eb0dd865431f46515da9f82ccc"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200","CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-05T22:02:37Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-05T19:15:52Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
