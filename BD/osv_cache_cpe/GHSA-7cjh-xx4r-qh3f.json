You may be impacted if you meet the following conditions:\n- Using any `sentry-android` with versions < 8.14.0 \n- Using Jetpack Compose >= [1.8.0-alpha08](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-ui#1.8.0-alpha08)\n  - This includes any alpha, beta, release candidate, or general availability after this version\n- Have configured Sentry Session Replays for Android\n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> If you do not use Jetpack Compose or have never used a version >= 1.8.0-alpha08 you are not impacted. \n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> If you have not configured [Session Replays for Mobile](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/session-replay/mobile/) you are not impacted.\n\n### How do I check if I'm impacted?\n\nIf you meet the conditions above, the `sentry-android` package includes a [specific error log](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/blob/b2920907e6afb69a8027cedb251dd94a3514f0e6/sentry-android-replay/src/main/java/io/sentry/android/replay/viewhierarchy/ComposeViewHierarchyNode.kt#L252-L261) that would indicate you may be impacted. Customers may use [logcat](https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat) to search for this event.\n\n### I'm impacted and want this data deleted\n\nIf you've confirmed that you're affected and unmasked sensitive data in Session Replays have reached Sentry servers, you can please see this documentation on [deleting individual replays](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/session-replay/web/replay-details/#delete-replays). If you'd like to request bulk deletion, please reach out to your Account Manager or support@sentry.io to request deletion. \n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade the `sentry-android` SDK to version [8.14.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/tag/8.14.0)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of the SDK, but if it is not an option, customers may either:\n- Downgrade their use of Jetpack Compose to <= 1.7.x\n- Drop session sample rates to 0.0 \n```\noptions.sessionReplay.onErrorSampleRate = 0.0\noptions.sessionReplay.sessionSampleRate = 0.0\n```\nPlease see our documentation for more information configuring [Session Replays for Android](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/session-replay/#set-up).\n\n### References\n\nThis issue
