In environments where a compatible gadget chain is reachable, this can be abused to execute arbitrary code or alter server state; at minimum it enables high-impact integrity and confidentiality compromise on the IoTDB process.\n\n### Affected\n\nApache IoTDB **from 1.0.0 before 2.0.5**.\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to **2.0.5**, which addresses the flaw. If immediate upgrade is not possible, restrict exposure of IoTDB endpoints to trusted networks and disable or sanitize any feature paths that accept serialized payloads. These mitigations are defense-in-depth only; upgrading to 2.0.5 is the definitive fix.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.iotdb:iotdb-confignode","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.iotdb/iotdb-confignode"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.5"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.4-1","1.3.5","2.0.1-beta","2.0.2","2.0.2-1","2.0.3","2.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-776q-jw43-fhjx/GHSA-776q-jw43-fhjx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48459"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/commit/5ad4a940ed84abca27c7e8be86cb371a49900491"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-776q-jw43-fhjx"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/mr84n19nv8d0bmcrfsj3mm5ff5qn4q2f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/24/8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-24T18:58:41Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-24T08:15:32Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
