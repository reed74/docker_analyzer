Change is in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/943. jackson-core will throw a StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached.\njackson-databind also benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON inputs.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers should avoid parsing input files from untrusted sources.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.15.0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.0-RC1","2.0.0-RC2","2.0.0-RC3","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.10.0","2.10.0.pr1","2.10.0.pr2","2.10.0.pr3","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.4","2.10.5","2.11.0","2.11.0.rc1","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.11.3","2.11.4","2.12.0","2.12.0-rc1","2.12.0-rc2","2.12.1","2.12.2","2.12.3","2.12.4","2.12.5","2.12.6","2.12.7","2.13.0","2.13.0-rc1","2.13.0-rc2","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.13.4","2.13.5","2.14.0","2.14.0-rc1","2.14.0-rc2","2.14.0-rc3","2.14.1","2.14.2","2.14.3","2.15.0-rc1","2.15.0-rc2","2.15.0-rc3","2.2.0","2.2.0-rc1","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.3.0","2.3.0-rc1","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.4.0","2.4.0-rc1","2.4.0-rc2","2.4.0-rc3","2.4.1","2.4.1.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.5.0","2.5.0-rc1","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.6.0","2.6.0-rc1","2.6.0-rc2","2.6.0-rc3","2.6.0-rc4","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.7.0","2.7.0-rc1","2.7.0-rc2","2.7.0-rc3","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.7.6","2.7.7","2.7.8","2.7.9","2.8.0","2.8.0.rc1","2.8.0.rc2","2.8.1","2.8.10","2.8.11","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.6","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.8.9","2.9.0","2.9.0.pr1","2.9.0.pr2","2.9.0.pr3","2.9.0.pr4","2.9.1","2.9.10","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","2.9.5","2.9.6","2.9.7","2.9.8","2.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3/GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52999"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/943"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-27T15:22:22Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-25T17:15:39Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
