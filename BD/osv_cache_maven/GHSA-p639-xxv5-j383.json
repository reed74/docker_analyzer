This is because FTP client code in HPL/SQL does not verify the destination location of the downloaded file. This does not affect hive cli user and hiveserver2 user as hplsql is a separate command line script and needs to be invoked differently.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.hive:hive","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.hive/hive"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.3.3"}]}],"versions":["2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2018/11/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.hive:hive-exec","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.hive/hive-exec"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.3.3"}]}],"versions":["2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2018/11/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.hive:hive-service","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.hive/hive-service"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.3.3"}]}],"versions":["2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2018/11/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1315"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p639-xxv5-j383"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d5da94ef60312c01a8d2348466680d1b5fb70702c71a3e84e94f7933@%3Cdev.hive.apache.org%3E"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-732"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2020-06-16T21:48:04Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
