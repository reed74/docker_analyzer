A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met:\n  *  SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker.\n  *  The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration.\n  *  At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions.\n  *  The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment.\n\n\nExploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.wso2.am:am-parent","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.wso2.am/am-parent"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.4.0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.0-alpha","2.1.0-update1","2.1.0-update10","2.1.0-update11","2.1.0-update12","2.1.0-update13","2.1.0-update14","2.1.0-update2","2.1.0-update3","2.1.0-update4","2.1.0-update5","2.1.0-update6","2.1.0-update7","2.1.0-update8","2.1.0-update9","2.2.0","2.2.0-m1","2.2.0-update1","2.2.0-update2","2.2.0-update3","2.2.0-update4","2.2.0-update5","2.2.0-update6","2.2.0-update7","2.5.0","2.5.0-Alpha","2.5.0-Beta","2.6.0","2.6.0-alpha","2.6.0-alpha2","2.6.0-beta","2.6.0-beta2","2.6.0-m1","2.6.0-m2","2.6.0-rc1","2.6.0-rc2","3.0.0","3.0.0-,3","3.0.0-alpha","3.0.0-beta","3.0.0-m10","3.0.0-m11","3.0.0-m12","3.0.0-m15","3.0.0-m16","3.0.0-m17","3.0.0-m18","3.0.0-m19","3.0.0-m20","3.0.0-m21","3.0.0-m27","3.0.0-m29","3.0.0-m3","3.0.0-m31","3.0.0-m32","3.0.0-m33","3.0.0-m35","3.0.0-m4","3.0.0-m5","3.0.0-m6","3.0.0-m7","3.0.0-m8","3.0.0-m9","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta","3.2.0","3.2.0-alpha","4.0.0","4.0.0-beta","4.1.0-alpha","4.1.0-m1","4.1.0-m2","4.1.0-m3","4.1.0-m4","4.2.0","4.2.0-beta","4.2.0-m1","4.4.0-alpha"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<=
