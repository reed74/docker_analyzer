{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-wcwh-7gfw-5wrr","published":"2025-09-23T17:37:23Z","modified":"2025-10-13T15:45:42.428092Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-59822"],"summary":"Http4s vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer section","details":"### Summary\nhttp4s is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer section.\nThis vulnerability could enable attackers to:\n- Bypass front-end servers security controls\n- Launch targeted attacks against active users\n- Poison web caches\n\nPre-requisites for the exploitation: the web appication has to be deployed behind a reverse-proxy that forwards trailer headers.\n\n### Details\nThe HTTP chunked message parser, after parsing the last body chunk, calls `parseTrailers` (`ember-core/shared/src/main/scala/org/http4s/ember/core/ChunkedEncoding.scala#L122-142`).\nThis method parses the trailer section using `Parser.parse`, where the issue originates.\n\n`parse` has a bug that allows to terminate the parsing before finding the double CRLF condition: when it finds an header line that **does not include the colon character**, it continues parsing with `state=false` looking for the header name till reaching the condition `else if (current == lf && (idx > 0 && message(idx - 1) == cr))` that sets `complete=true` even if no `\\r\\n\\r\\n` is  found.\n```scala\nif (current == colon) {\n  state = true // set state to check for header value\n  name = new String(message, start, idx - start) // extract name string\n  start = idx + 1 // advance past colon for next start\n\n  // TODO: This if clause may not be necessary since the header value parser trims\n  if (message.size > idx + 1 && message(idx + 1) == space) {\n    start += 1 // if colon is followed by space advance again\n    idx += 1 // double advance index here to skip the space\n  }\n  // double CRLF condition - Termination of headers\n} else if (current == lf && (idx > 0 && message(idx - 1) == cr)) { // <----- not a double CRLF check\n  complete = true // completed terminate loop\n}\n```\nThe remainder left in the buffer is then parsed as another request leading to HTTP Request Smuggling.\n\n### PoC\n\nStart a simple webserver that echoes the received requests:\n```scala\nimport cats.effect._\nimport cats.implicits._\nimport org.http4s._\nimport org.http4s.dsl.io._\nimport
