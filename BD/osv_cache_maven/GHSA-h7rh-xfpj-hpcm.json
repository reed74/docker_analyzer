This unintended behavior could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including credentials, file paths, or system configuration details, if such references were present in XML content from untrusted sources.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n- minio-java < 8.6.0\n\nAll applications utilizing affected versions of minio-java for parsing XML with potentially untrusted input are vulnerable.\n\n#### Impact\nThis vulnerability poses a high risk of information disclosure. Attackers could craft malicious XML inputs to extract sensitive data from the system's properties or environment variables, potentially compromising security in applications relying on minio-java for object storage operations.\n\n#### Patches\nThe issue is resolved in minio-java version 8.6.0 and later. In these versions, automatic substitution of XML tag values with system properties or environment variables has been disabled.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to minio-java 8.6.0 or a newer release to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n#### Workarounds\nNo full workarounds exist without upgrading the library. As interim measures:\n\n- Refrain from processing XML data from untrusted or external sources.\n- Implement input sanitization or validation to detect and remove references to \n  system properties or environment variables in XML content.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"io.minio:minio","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/io.minio/minio"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.6.0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.1.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.11","3.0.12","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.10","6.0.11","6.0.12","6.0.13","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.0.8","6.0.9","7.0.0","7.0.1","7.0.2","7.1.0","7.1.2","7.1.3","7.1.4","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.2.2","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.3.4","8.3.5","8.3.6","8.3.7","8.3.8","8.3.9","8.4.0","8.4.1","8.4.2","8.4.3","8.4.4","8.4.5","8.4.6","8.5.0","8.5.1","8.5.10","8.5.11","8.5.12","8.5.13","8.5.14","8.5.15","8.5.16","8.5.17","8.5.2","8.5.3","8.5.4","8.5.5","8.5.6","8.5.7","8.5.8","8.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-h7rh-xfpj-hpcm/GHSA-h7rh-xfpj-hpcm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/minio/minio-java/security/advisories/GHSA-h7rh-xfpj-hpcm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59952"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/minio/minio-java/commit/f7a98d06b25e5464bdd4811b044e25ff9101d37f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/minio/minio-java"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/minio/minio-java/releases/tag/8.6.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-91"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-29T17:53:31Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-30T04:43:46Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
