ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.\n\nExisting users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-openwire-legacy","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-openwire-legacy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.16.8"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0","5.10.1","5.10.2","5.11.0","5.11.1","5.11.2","5.11.3","5.11.4","5.12.0","5.12.1","5.12.2","5.12.3","5.13.0","5.13.1","5.13.2","5.13.3","5.13.4","5.13.5","5.14.0","5.14.1","5.14.2","5.14.3","5.14.4","5.14.5","5.15.0","5.15.1","5.15.10","5.15.11","5.15.12","5.15.13","5.15.14","5.15.15","5.15.16","5.15.2","5.15.3","5.15.4","5.15.5","5.15.6","5.15.7","5.15.8","5.15.9","5.16.0","5.16.1","5.16.2","5.16.3","5.16.4","5.16.5","5.16.6","5.16.7","5.8.0","5.9.0","5.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-client","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-client"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.16.8"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0","5.10.1","5.10.2","5.11.0","5.11.1","5.11.2","5.11.3","5.11.4","5.12.0","5.12.1","5.12.2","5.12.3","5.13.0","5.13.1","5.13.2","5.13.3","5.13.4","5.13.5","5.14.0","5.14.1","5.14.2","5.14.3","5.14.4","5.14.5","5.15.0","5.15.1","5.15.10","5.15.11","5.15.12","5.15.13","5.15.14","5.15.15","5.15.16","5.15.2","5.15.3","5.15.4","5.15.5","5.15.6","5.15.7","5.15.8","5.15.9","5.16.0","5.16.1","5.16.2","5.16.3","5.16.4","5.16.5","5.16.6","5.16.7","5.8.0","5.9.0","5.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-openwire-legacy","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-openwire-legacy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.7"}]}],"versions":["5.17.0","5.17.1","5.17.2","5.17.3","5.17.4","5.17.5","5.17.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-openwire-legacy","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-openwire-legacy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.7"}]}],"versions":["5.18.0","5.18.1","5.18.2","5.18.3","5.18.4","5.18.5","5.18.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-openwire-legacy","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-openwire-legacy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.6"}]}],"versions":["6.0.0","6.0.1","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-client","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-client"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.7"}]}],"versions":["5.17.0","5.17.1","5.17.2","5.17.3","5.17.4","5.17.5","5.17.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-client","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-client"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.7"}]}],"versions":["5.18.0","5.18.1","5.18.2","5.18.3","5.18.4","5.18.5","5.18.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.activemq:activemq-client","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-client"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.6"}]}],"versions":["6.0.0","6.0.1","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c/GHSA-whxr-3p84-rf3c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27533"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/commit/fc4372b9f0f72b8b5eed917f0019c5cea45c5d06"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6596"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/8hcm25vf7mchg4
