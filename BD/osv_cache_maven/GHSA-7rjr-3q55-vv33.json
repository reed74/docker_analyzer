{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33","published":"2021-12-14T18:01:28Z","modified":"2025-10-22T19:37:53.742023Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-45046"],"summary":"Incomplete fix for Apache Log4j vulnerability","details":"# Impact\n\nThe fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a remote code execution (RCE) attack. \n\n## Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\n# Mitigation\n\nLog4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (< 2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).\n\nLog4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.13.0"},{"fixed":"2.16.0"}]}],"versions":["2.13.0","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.15.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.2"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.0-alpha1","2.0-alpha2","2.0-beta1","2.0-beta2","2.0-beta3","2.0-beta4","2.0-beta5","2.0-beta6","2.0-beta7","2.0-beta8","2.0-beta9","2.0-rc1","2.0-rc2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1","2.10.0","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.2","2.3","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4","2.4.1","2.5","2.6","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.7","2.8","2.8.1","2.8.2","2.9.0","2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.8.0"},{"fixed":"1.9.2"}]}],"versions":["1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.9.0","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.10.0"},{"fixed":"1.10.8"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.11.0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.10","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.11.8","1.11.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.12"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00646.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5022"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2021-45046"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0032"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SIG7FZULMNK2XF6FZRU4VWYDQXNMUGAJ"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EOKPQGV24RRBBI4TBZUDQMM4MEH7MXCY"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-anno
