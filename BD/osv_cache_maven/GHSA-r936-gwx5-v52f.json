Because we cannot check exploits against all Servlet containers and configuration variants, we strongly recommend upgrading your application.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.springframework:spring-webmvc","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.springframework/spring-webmvc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.10"}]}],"versions":["6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3","6.2.4","6.2.5","6.2.6","6.2.7","6.2.8","6.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.springframework:spring-webmvc","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.springframework/spring-webmvc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"last_affected":"6.1.21"}]}],"versions":["6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.10","6.1.11","6.1.12","6.1.13","6.1.14","6.1.15","6.1.16","6.1.17","6.1.18","6.1.19","6.1.2","6.1.20","6.1.21","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.1.6","6.1.7","6.1.8","6.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.springframework:spring-webmvc","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.springframework/spring-webmvc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"last_affected":"6.0.29"}]}],"versions":["6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.10","6.0.11","6.0.12","6.0.13","6.0.14","6.0.15","6.0.16","6.0.17","6.0.18","6.0.19","6.0.2","6.0.20","6.0.21","6.0.22","6.0.23","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.0.8","6.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.springframework:spring-webmvc","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.springframework/spring-webmvc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.3.0"},{"last_affected":"5.3.43"}]}],"versions":["5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.10","5.3.11","5.3.12","5.3.13","5.3.14","5.3.15","5.3.16","5.3.17","5.3.18","5.3.19","5.3.2","5.3.20","5.3.21","5.3.22","5.3.23","5.3.24","5.3.25","5.3.26","5.3.27","5.3.28","5.3.29","5.3.3","5.3.30","5.3.31","5.3.32","5.3.33","5.3.34","5.3.35","5.3.36","5.3.37","5.3.38","5.3.39","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.3.6","5.3.7","5.3.8","5.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-41242"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41242"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-18T22:27:13Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-18T09:15:28Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
