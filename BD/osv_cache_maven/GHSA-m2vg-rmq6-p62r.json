This can then be used to modify the site or to execute actions in the name of logged-in users.\n\nTo inject malicious metadata, an attacker needs write access to the system. For example, the ability to upload media and modify metadata. This cannot be exploited by unauthenticated users.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, however they are not published to the Maven registry.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Patch fixing the issue](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/2809520fa88d108d8104c760f00c10bad42c14f9)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n* Email us at [security@opencast.org](mailto:security@opencast.org)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.opencastproject:opencast-common","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-common"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"16.10"}]}],"versions":["10.0","10.1","10.10","10.11","10.12","10.2","10.3","10.4","10.5","10.6","10.7","10.8","10.9","11.0","11.1","11.10","11.11","11.2","11.3","11.4","11.5","11.6","11.7","11.8","11.9","12.0","12.1","12.11","12.12","12.13","12.2","12.3","12.5","12.6","12.7","12.8","12.9","13.0","13.1","13.10","13.11","13.12","13.2","13.4","13.6","13.7","13.8","14.0","14.1","14.10","14.11","14.12","14.13","14.2","14.3","14.5","14.6","14.7","14.8","14.9","15.0","15.1","15.10","15.11","15.12","15.13","15.2","15.3","15.4","15.5","15.6","15.7","15.8","15.9","16.0","16.1","16.10","16.2","16.3","16.4","16.5","16.6","16.7","16.8","16.9","6.6","7.2","7.3","7.4","7.5","7.6","7.7","7.8","7.9","8.0","8.1","8.10","8.11","8.3","8.4","8.5","8.6","8.7","8.8","8.9","9.0","9.1","9.10","9.11","9.12","9.2","9.3","9.4","9.5","9.6","9.7","9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-m2vg-rmq6-p62r/GHSA-m2vg-rmq6-p62r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-m2vg-rmq6-p62r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61788"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/2809520fa88d108d8104c760f00c10bad42c14f9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-08T20:33:31Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-08T18:15:35Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
