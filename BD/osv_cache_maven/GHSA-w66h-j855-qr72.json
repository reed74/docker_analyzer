Amongst other things, the attacker can:\n1. Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.\n2. View any information that the user is able to view.\n3. Modify any information that the user is able to modify.\n4. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.\n\n### Workarounds\nChanging any of the following WMS service settings should mitigate this vulnerability in most environments:\n1. Enable GetFeatureInfo HTML auto-escaping (available in GeoServer 2.21.3+ and 2.22.1+)\n2. Disable dynamic styling\n3. Disable GetFeatureInfo text/html MIME type\n\n### References\nhttps://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11297\nhttps://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/7406","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.geoserver.web:gs-web-app","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.geoserver.web/gs-web-app"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.25.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-w66h-j855-qr72/GHSA-w66h-j855-qr72.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.geoserver:gs-wms","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.geoserver/gs-wms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.25.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-w66h-j855-qr72/GHSA-w66h-j855-qr72.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-w66h-j855-qr72"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21621"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/7406"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/commit/dc9ff1c726dd73c884437a123b4ad72b19383c7d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11203"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11297"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-25T18:41:53Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-25T22:15:47Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
