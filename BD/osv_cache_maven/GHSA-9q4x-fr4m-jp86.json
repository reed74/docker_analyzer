Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that \"an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of\nthe base file\". However, when the path contains encoded \"..\"\ncharacters (for example, \"%2E%2E/bar.txt\"), it might return file objects that are not\na descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.commons:commons-vfs2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.commons/commons-vfs2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.0"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.1","2.2","2.3","2.4","2.4.1","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-9q4x-fr4m-jp86/GHSA-9q4x-fr4m-jp86.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27553"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/commons-vfs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/cnzqowyw9r2pl263cylmxhnvh41hyjcb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00006.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/23/1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-23"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-25T03:21:09Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-23T15:15:13Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
