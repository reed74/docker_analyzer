{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-qx7g-fx8q-545g","published":"2025-06-06T15:49:58Z","modified":"2025-06-13T16:14:59.114912Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-49009"],"summary":"Para Inserts Sensitive Information into Log File for Facebook authentication","details":"CWE ID: CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)\nCVSS: 6.2 (Medium)\nVector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\n**Affected Component:** Facebook Authentication Logging\n**Version:** Para v1.50.6\n**File Path:** para-1.50.6/para-server/src/main/java/com/erudika/para/server/security/filters/FacebookAuthFilter.java\n**Vulnerable Line(s):** Line 184 (logger.warn(...) with raw access token)\n\nTechnical Details:\n\nThe vulnerability is located in FacebookAuthFilter.java, where a failed request to Facebook’s user profile endpoint triggers the following log statement:\n```java\nlogger.warn(\"Facebook auth request failed: GET \" + PROFILE_URL + accessToken, e);`\n```\n\nHere, `PROFILE_URL` is a constant:\n```java\nprivate static final String PROFILE_URL = \"https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=name,email,picture.width(400).type(square).height(400)&access_token=\";\n```\nThis results in the full request URL being logged, including the user's access token in plain text. Since WARN-level logs are often retained in production and accessible to operators or log aggregation systems, this poses a risk of token exposure.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.erudika:para-server","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.erudika/para-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.50.8"}]}],"versions":["1.13","1.14","1.14.1","1.15","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.0","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.18.3","1.18.4","1.18.5","1.18.6","1.18.7","1.18.8","1.18.9","1.19.0","1.20.0","1.21.0","1.21.1","1.22.0","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.24.0","1.24.1","1.24.2","1.24.3","1.24.4","1.24.5","1.25.0","1.25.1","1.25.2","1.25.3","1.25.4","1.25.5","1.26.0","1.26.1","1.26.2","1.27.0","1.28.0","1.28.1","1.28.2","1.28.3","1.28.4","1.28.5","1.29.0","1.29.1","1.29.2","1.30.0","1.30.1","1.30.2","1.31.0","1.31.1","1.31.2","1.31.3","1.32.0","1.33.0","1.33.1","1.34.0","1.34.1","1.34.2","1.34.3","1.35.0","1.36.0","1.36.1","1.37.0","1.37.1","1.38.0","1.38.1","1.38.2","1.38.3","1.38.4","1.39.0","1.39.1","1.40.0","1.41.0","1.41.1","1.41.2","1.41.3","1.42.0","1.42.1","1.42.2","1.43.0","1.43.1","1.43.2","1.43.3","1.43.4","1.44.0","1.45.0","1.45.1","1.45.10","1.45.2","1.45.3","1.45.4","1.45.5","1.45.6","1.45.7","1.45.8","1.45.9","1.46.0","1.46.1","1.46.2","1.46.3","1.47.0","1.47.1","1.47.2","1.48.0","1.48.1","1.48.2","1.49.0","1.49.1","1.49.2","1.49.3","1.49.4","1.49.5","1.50.0","1.50.1","1.50.2","1.50.3","1.50.4","1.50.5","1.50.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-qx7g-fx8q-545g/GHSA-qx7g-fx8q-545g.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Erudika/para/security/advisories/GHSA-qx7g-fx8q-545g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49009"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Erudika/para/commit/46a908d887da02037384193f70a69345f04887cf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Erudika/para"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-06T15:49:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-05T17:15:29Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
