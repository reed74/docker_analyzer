While libraries in the global configuration can only be set up by administrators and can therefore be trusted, libraries defined in folders can be configured by users with Item/Configure permission.\n\nIn Templating Engine Plugin 2.5.3 and earlier, libraries defined in folders are not subject to sandbox protection. This vulnerability allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.\n\nIn Templating Engine Plugin 2.5.4, libraries defined in folders are subject to sandbox protection.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.jenkins-ci.plugins:templating-engine","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/templating-engine"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.4"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.1","1.1.1","1.2","1.3","1.4","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.5","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6","1.7","1.7.1","2.0","2.0-alpha","2.0-alpha2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1","2.2","2.2.1","2.2.1.1","2.2.2","2.3","2.4","2.5","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-4vjp-327p-w4qv/GHSA-4vjp-327p-w4qv.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31722"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/commit/bb2b4468b3bf4cea494afb8549af4e6450972653"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2025-04-02/#SECURITY-3505"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-02T22:39:27Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-02T15:15:59Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
