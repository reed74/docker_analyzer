While modern Java implementations typically default to secure TLS versions even with the \"SSL\" identifier, explicitly using \"TLS\" ensures that only secure TLS protocols are negotiated.\n\nThe affected components were:\n\n* GeoIP Processor: The `DBSource.initiateSSL()` method used for downloading GeoIP databases from external sources\n\n* Kafka Plugin: Both `CustomClientSslEngineFactory` and `InsecureSslEngineFactory` classes used for Kafka client connections\n\nThis could potentially allow connections to negotiate weaker SSL protocols instead of enforcing modern TLS versions, reducing the security of data transmission.\n\n### Patches\n\nData Prepper 2.12.2 contains a fix for this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible:\n\n1. Ensure your Java runtime is configured to disable deprecated SSL protocols\n2. Use network-level controls to enforce TLS-only connections\n3. Use external tools to verify that deprecated SSL protocols are not allowed.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.opensearch.dataprepper.plugins:geoip-processor","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.opensearch.dataprepper.plugins/geoip-processor"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.4.0"},{"fixed":"2.12.2"}]}],"versions":["2.12.0","2.12.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-28gg-8qqj-fhh5/GHSA-28gg-8qqj-fhh5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/security/advisories/GHSA-28gg-8qqj-fhh5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/fa21a601512b5193c4b5c84a5b30c6301dab0475"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-295"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-15T20:37:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
