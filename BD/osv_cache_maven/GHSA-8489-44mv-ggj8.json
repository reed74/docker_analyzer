This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.\n\n\n# Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\nThis issue does not impact default configurations of Log4j2 and requires an attacker to have control over the Log4j2 configuration, which reduces the likelihood of being exploited.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0-beta7"},{"fixed":"2.3.2"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.0-beta7","2.0-beta8","2.0-beta9","2.0-rc1","2.0-rc2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1","2.2","2.3","2.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.4"},{"fixed":"2.12.4"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.12.2","2.12.3","2.4","2.4.1","2.5","2.6","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.7","2.8","2.8.1","2.8.2","2.9.0","2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.13.0"},{"fixed":"2.17.1"}]}],"versions":["2.13.0","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.15.0","2.16.0","2.17.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.8.0"},{"fixed":"1.9.2"}]}],"versions":["1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.9.0","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.10.0"},{"fixed":"1.10.9"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.11.0"},{"fixed":"1.11.13"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.10","1.11.11","1.11.12","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.11.8","1.11.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.ops4j.pax.logging:pax-logging-log4j2","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.14"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.12","2.0.13","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8/GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3293"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/s1o5vlo78ypqxnzn6p8zf6t9shtq5143"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00036.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EVV25FXL4FU5X6X5BSL7RLQ7T6F65MRA"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T57MPJUW3MA6QGWZRTMCHHMMPQNVKGFC"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220104-0001"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/28/1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-74"],"github_reviewed":true,"g
