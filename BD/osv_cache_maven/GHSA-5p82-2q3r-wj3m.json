The exploit can be triggered when any user accesses the public API endpoint of the malicious SVG images, or if the malicious images are embedded in an `iframe` element, during a widget creation, deployed to any page of the platform (e.g., dashboards), and accessed during normal operations. The vulnerability resides in the `ImageController`, which fails to restrict the execution of JavaScript code when an image is loaded by the user's browser. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.thingsboard:application","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.thingsboard/application"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-5p82-2q3r-wj3m/GHSA-5p82-2q3r-wj3m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3261"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/commit/b2ae6f92d12206ea185a2e882945a6b69234bf03"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CVE-2025-3261"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-01T23:57:42Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-27T18:15:46Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
