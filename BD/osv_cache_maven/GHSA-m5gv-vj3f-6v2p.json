This allows remote authenticated admin users with the Instance Administrator role to execute arbitrary Groovy scripts (i.e., remote code execution) through Object actions. \n\nIn contrast, in Liferay DXP (Liferay SaaS), the use of Groovy in Object actions is not allowed due to the high security risks it poses. \n\nStarting from Liferay DXP 2024.Q2 and later, a new feature has been introduced in Instance Settings that allows administrators to configure whether Groovy scripts are allowed in their instances.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.liferay:com.liferay.object.service","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.liferay/com.liferay.object.service"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.96"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.11","1.0.12","1.0.13","1.0.14","1.0.15","1.0.16","1.0.17","1.0.18","1.0.19","1.0.2","1.0.20","1.0.21","1.0.22","1.0.23","1.0.24","1.0.25","1.0.26","1.0.27","1.0.28","1.0.29","1.0.3","1.0.30","1.0.31","1.0.32","1.0.33","1.0.34","1.0.35","1.0.36","1.0.37","1.0.38","1.0.39","1.0.4","1.0.40","1.0.41","1.0.42","1.0.43","1.0.44","1.0.45","1.0.46","1.0.47","1.0.48","1.0.49","1.0.5","1.0.50","1.0.51","1.0.52","1.0.53","1.0.54","1.0.55","1.0.56","1.0.57","1.0.58","1.0.59","1.0.6","1.0.60","1.0.61","1.0.62","1.0.63","1.0.64","1.0.65","1.0.66","1.0.67","1.0.68","1.0.69","1.0.7","1.0.70","1.0.71","1.0.72","1.0.73","1.0.74","1.0.75","1.0.76","1.0.77","1.0.78","1.0.79","1.0.8","1.0.80","1.0.81","1.0.82","1.0.83","1.0.84","1.0.85","1.0.86","1.0.87","1.0.88","1.0.89","1.0.9","1.0.90","1.0.91","1.0.92","1.0.93","1.0.94","1.0.95"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-m5gv-vj3f-6v2p/GHSA-m5gv-vj3f-6v2p.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3586"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/3b9e3bb1462ccd33ede05f73f45b38b8262f018f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/79ddc243e60864c0c30cfccb1cc46e705e922cb0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/commit/b2aa19be228fb308ebe8ae1f47d3224e1fd06225"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LPE-17586"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://liferay.dev/portal/security/known-vulnerabilities/-/asset_publisher/jekt/content/CVE-2025-3586"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-12T22:12:32Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-01T18:15:29Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
