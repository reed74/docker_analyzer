The library resolves the URI to a file path and after reading, the content is encoded as base64 and included in the HTML output as a data URI. An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the conversion is performed or cause an excessive resources consumption by crafting a docx file that links to special device files such as /dev/random or /dev/zero.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mammoth","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/mammoth"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.3.25"},{"fixed":"1.11.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.zwobble.mammoth:mammoth","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.zwobble.mammoth/mammoth"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","1.10.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.5.0","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mammoth","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/mammoth"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0.3.25"},{"fixed":"1.11.0"}]}],"versions":["0.3.25","0.3.26","0.3.27","0.3.29","0.3.30","0.3.31","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.17","1.4.18","1.4.19","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.8.0","1.9.0","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Mammoth","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Mammoth"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87/GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11849"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js/commit/c54aaeb43a7941317c1f3c119ffa92090f988820"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/AudunWA/4d690d9ae5efdafe7cf71d9c2ee90a10"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mwilliamson/java-mammoth"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-MAMMOTH-13561968"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGZWOBBLEMAMMOTH-13561969"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MAMMOTH-13554470"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-MAMMOTH-13561967"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-17T17:50:00Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-17T05:15:33Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:H/E:P"}]}
