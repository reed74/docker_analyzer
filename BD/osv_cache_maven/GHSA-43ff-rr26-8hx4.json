This behavior bypassed SSL certificate validation, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and modify data in transit through man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability affects connections to OpenSearch when the `cert` parameter is not explicitly provided.\n\n### Patches\n\nData Prepper 2.12.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot immediately upgrade to the fixed version, you can implement the following workaround.\n\n#### OpenSearch sink\n\nAdd the `cert` parameter to your OpenSearch sink configuration with the path to your cluster's CA certificate. The following example shows how to accomplish this.\n\n```\nsink:\n  - opensearch:\n      hosts: [\"https://your-opensearch-cluster:9200\"]\n      cert: /path/to/your/ca-certificate.pem\n```\n\n#### OpenSearch source\n\nAdd the `cert` parameter to your OpenSearch sink configuration with the path to your cluster's CA certificate. The following example shows how to accomplish this.\n\n```\nsink:\n  - opensearch:\n      hosts: [\"https://your-opensearch-cluster:9200\"]\n      connection:\n        cert: /path/to/your/ca-certificate.pem\n```\n\n\n### References\n\nN/A","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.opensearch.dataprepper.plugins:opensearch","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.opensearch.dataprepper.plugins/opensearch"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.2"}]}],"versions":["2.12.0","2.12.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-43ff-rr26-8hx4/GHSA-43ff-rr26-8hx4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/security/advisories/GHSA-43ff-rr26-8hx4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62371"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/98fcf0d0ff9c18f1f7501e11dbed918814724b99"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/b0386a5af3fb71094ba6c86cd8b2afc783246599"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/db11ce8f27ebca018980b2bca863f7173de9ce56"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-295"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-15T20:09:53Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-15T18:15:39Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
