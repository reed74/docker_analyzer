However, any member attribute of that object remains available to search queries. This allows to reconstruct the original field contents using range queries. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been resolved in OpenSearch 3.0.0 and OpenSearch 2.19.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf FLS exclusion rules are used for object valued attributes  (like `~object`), add an additional exclusion rule for the members of the object  (like `~object.*`).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.opensearch.plugin:opensearch-security","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.opensearch.plugin/opensearch-security"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.19.3.0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.0.0","2.10.0.0","2.11.0.0","2.11.1.0","2.12.0.0","2.13.0.0","2.14.0.0","2.15.0.0","2.16.0.0","2.17.0.0","2.17.1.0","2.18.0.0","2.19.0.0","2.19.1.0","2.19.2.0","2.2.0.0","2.2.1.0","2.3.0.0","2.4.0.0","2.4.1.0","2.5.0.0","2.6.0.0","2.7.0.0","2.8.0.0","2.9.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-2rjv-cv85-xhgm/GHSA-2rjv-cv85-xhgm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-2rjv-cv85-xhgm"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/opensearch-project/security"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-01T18:15:03Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
