In fact, the uploader has shortly published a few similar packages appearing to be e.g. an integration for a known application, but containing only a \"telemetry\" module exfiltrating basic info about the user. This package has no other purpose than collecting data about users. In addition, it appears to be largely generated by an LLM.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-12- sajansubedi\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username.
