Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest?

It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (a757e3e7e6ccbf2eb843b7fcb8938c8dd5e4d5daf874e48be2c3e29a2dbc4e45)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c' @ 0.2.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c"},"versions":["0.2.0","0.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c/MAL-2024-8051.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-28T08:36:11.49810139Z","modified_time":"2024-08-28T08:10:54Z","sha256":"a757e3e7e6ccbf2eb843b7fcb8938c8dd5e4d5daf874e48be2c3e29a2dbc4e45","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.2.0"]},{"id":"RLMA-2024-10970","import_time":"2024-12-09T14:38:40.730680049Z","modified_time":"2024-12-09T06:49:46Z","sha256":"bda4b3cfebe716b35deec05fd3ded743a5cb9cd4d55c26b3447473b661ee3670","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["0.2.0","0.3.0"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.921828542Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"2483831a74ac3f6a471558a15519b5895df179d3946b9291291a0f7fbeb0462a","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.96224757Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"2325acb67ca59e847fd003a5449350d2b0b12620ed80cb82cc6189f091bdacc7","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-3eef6c2c","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.265897229Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"1357091ac7cf3e2d7b6ae8c65e554ddf235c56dc4a45d99b34789c3fed287bc3","source":"kam193","versions":["0.2.0","0.3.0"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
