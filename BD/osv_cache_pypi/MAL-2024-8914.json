Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (0d59708de6a93515ddf3dce03f6051e168f3b881c22274793c91c2d646617a51)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2' @ 1.0.3 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2"},"versions":["1.0.3","0.1.1","0.1","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.6","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.5","1.0.2","1.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2/MAL-2024-8914.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-09-19T23:05:29.37158436Z","modified_time":"2024-09-19T22:51:37Z","sha256":"0d59708de6a93515ddf3dce03f6051e168f3b881c22274793c91c2d646617a51","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["1.0.3"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.923474078Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"37e4e2b21c3950495a9aa6629b566b4ee61fdb2f2cd9e1ac3cf754e101394ac5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.963739532Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"73c351156cf1e0c234b98d0e640c60c93c88c92d42109fe64cbb83dd68e82375","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.267654004Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"2eba3013977accb647f762873ba38b0f7d0ad4f8b50438c30792339629147e5c","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1","0.1","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.6","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.5","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
