The application does not verify whether the attacker is an administrator, allowing the attacker to directly call the /api/v1/prompts/ interface to retrieve all prompt information created by the admin, which includes the ID values. Subsequently, the attacker can exploit the /api/v1/prompts/command/{command_id} interface to obtain arbitrary prompt information.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"open-webui","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/open-webui"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.3.8"}]}],"versions":["0.1.124","0.1.125","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","0.3.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-c7fq-p62p-wvpc/GHSA-c7fq-p62p-wvpc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7045"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/03ea0826-af7b-4717-b63e-90fd19675ab2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1100","CWE-862"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-21T17:26:53Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-20T10:15:35Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
