It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f"},"versions":["1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f/MAL-2024-12202.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.932784141Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"cd23374eee3a410cfa80db0fc2303e021d98555548447ac1788f39758771bd3b","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.97248068Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"902094a9d90c1b9cc5eca3aa3d809929f664931dfa9feaea432bf85d205b06ed","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b9485a2f","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.277353476Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"188643a881f935f44070e5df686e60bdaf0cdf68371c4cb2a6ab7bc0208b2993","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
