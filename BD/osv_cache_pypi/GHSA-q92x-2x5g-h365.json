The `load` function uses `is_path_within_directory` to validate files during `data.tar.gz` extraction, which fails to effectively detect symbolic and hard links. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file writes, potentially resulting in arbitrary command execution if critical files are overwritten.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"zenml","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/zenml"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0.81.0"},{"fixed":"0.84.2"}]}],"versions":["0.81.0","0.82.0","0.82.1","0.83.0","0.83.1","0.84.0","0.84.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-q92x-2x5g-h365/GHSA-q92x-2x5g-h365.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8406"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/commit/5d22a48d7bf6c7f10b748577c2be79cc7969d398"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/a0880d64-9928-45bf-9663-2cd81582d9e7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-07T13:02:28Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-05T09:15:31Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
