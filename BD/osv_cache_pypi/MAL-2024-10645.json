Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (f202668d0257d93c9db7e000752b8802d83806caecb1b4f832e50afa7c58337f)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'projectp' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"projectp","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/projectp"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/projectp/MAL-2024-10645.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/projectp"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:37:36.523005128Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:31:34Z","sha256":"f202668d0257d93c9db7e000752b8802d83806caecb1b4f832e50afa7c58337f","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/projectp","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.316047588Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"d242dcf0dc015b9ecdc884040f1c6c329b700ddf7f6afee3cc5f96e7f41a6933","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/projectp","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.505761943Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"f40cc91696052e8a21ac505ab295f1e6ca955f84096a8196bea68ed42a34e79c","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/projectp","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.618993916Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"16b141dfec54e900c553517b493d3faac3eac558d9be782601b49271da66f842","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
