Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63"},"versions":["0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63/MAL-2024-12198.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.919004652Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"696c7ac85e62434e778a406e645d4ed6cb2ff694b042efd603f14331de56319e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.959599757Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a814378a8188b464c5289007203c2b20c3ec2a0383ee18bd96e0f41ad44d7982","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-34b21b63","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.263020136Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"3157f4265540eac9356511b8607870bffc17a261b00c240ff6cbc5bcb7375716","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
