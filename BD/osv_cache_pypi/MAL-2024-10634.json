Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (e09dc65360609f288ec4cd4f5d2e92f98dddc0b6097ac2f217be6c258130018a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'feddecorr' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"feddecorr","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/feddecorr"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/feddecorr/MAL-2024-10634.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/feddecorr"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:06:52.418960634Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:06:00Z","sha256":"e09dc65360609f288ec4cd4f5d2e92f98dddc0b6097ac2f217be6c258130018a","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/feddecorr","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.040157976Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"eb99b19927733d2c7e357dced11a0ec3999e94a6dd1601d43b178f7b7c2d5924","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/feddecorr","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.231817867Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"5a08a1b5896ec91ef4da59089d8a049b09c25bca64483a9fd8547eec3710615a","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/feddecorr","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.374135161Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"6df650b93fa32333e3db2c127962b220b95ac7d5cec1a8f6071aebf2783751ed","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
