Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (11b1345d2836c38bfe88ff677f6137f804e68acf077cdcbaef0003aa0f84355a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e' @ 1.0.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e"},"versions":["1.0.1","1.0.4","1.0.2","1.0.3","0.1.2","0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e/MAL-2024-10473.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T16:06:10.965876659Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T15:43:55Z","sha256":"11b1345d2836c38bfe88ff677f6137f804e68acf077cdcbaef0003aa0f84355a","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["1.0.1"]},{"import_time":"2024-11-07T16:38:32.286412736Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T16:18:18Z","sha256":"3ede1b74e4bd77062eb0126b272a3516d648aa847b03a73da29270112781d8e1","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["1.0.4"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.912238601Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"82068dab0487a25fe1b69c6ba0cce93c50ea7a6113ffd1578ab1bc3698e1c138","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.95362196Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"ce38f402ec2ebebcc95e82007ff5807caab91173d1823fe9aa89db982083701e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-02f73e0e","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.256501194Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"665e4772b7db1193b8a29979dd58dabfcb409476ca6f80c5b909c63a35804419","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","0.1.2","0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
