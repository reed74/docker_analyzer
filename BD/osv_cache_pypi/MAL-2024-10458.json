Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9037f31355ffc41eb4b683a9a121ea7b0f2a419f206cc88b8fae20bd9006ca86)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'salmonn' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"salmonn","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/salmonn"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/salmonn/MAL-2024-10458.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/salmonn"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:29.411865163Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:41Z","sha256":"9037f31355ffc41eb4b683a9a121ea7b0f2a419f206cc88b8fae20bd9006ca86","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/salmonn","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.387171706Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"eb5b6d6fb4468765efc0ea78c0e81d767e0ca42f5ce8f54d7130978d1bc529d1","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/salmonn","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.574485593Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"265be3b9ce3923f5c8f1c75789dbf309618133d24804de0d2abd46ac2bde52c3","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/salmonn","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.676885865Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"3ac0fdd0a1ca8f276337166746ec8b2719279a60c3eb481d52a1e36b7fcaf7df","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
