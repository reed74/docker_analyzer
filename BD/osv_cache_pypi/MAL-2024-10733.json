Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (8de49c106b0e804da1a7c3b787f1886e32b9e27bb2352082c7b5e649b0432840)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'typing-extension' @ 95.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"typing-extension","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/typing-extension"},"versions":["95.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/typing-extension/MAL-2024-10733.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/typing-extension"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-15T09:35:12.967407758Z","modified_time":"2024-11-15T09:07:20Z","sha256":"8de49c106b0e804da1a7c3b787f1886e32b9e27bb2352082c7b5e649b0432840","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["95.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/typing-extension","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.480305318Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"21c7c7eebc90636d2bdf54815592787834f48fd31ba4404ee8922530745cf93e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/typing-extension","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.660332551Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a4f2379794c21a682400394b2df6d8b9e278128bf36a6c23dd342fec8bf332a5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/typing-extension","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.757289143Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"9a6305581a485302827d589323936b7a3015f0c43cbdd83d5686f573a6f2ff46","source":"kam193","versions":["95.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
