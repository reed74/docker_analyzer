Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (86e0b0bb9efa9e38916bcec9d1b6335230de7dd7253b5d450cfaa3d6eddd235a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'hybrid-sd' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hybrid-sd","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/hybrid-sd"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/hybrid-sd/MAL-2024-10452.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/hybrid-sd"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:30.61899807Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:52Z","sha256":"86e0b0bb9efa9e38916bcec9d1b6335230de7dd7253b5d450cfaa3d6eddd235a","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/hybrid-sd","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.111020317Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b072996e5cee432c038798e602475b7ad45fd882a75b6d75fc034d563576eabf","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/hybrid-sd","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.298718929Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"4eda2147ea1298ff5478fd2930bbb036f0b939a970e6c5ee1e9897f451957bea","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/hybrid-sd","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.431107195Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"cbec248566fcdaa529abfdb97ff712eb6fe5f57f6cc780be24fa10532e058367","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
