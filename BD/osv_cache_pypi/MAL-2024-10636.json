Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (db4300765f1658c2aea7cd741a96b021a92337dbb97807c037e67e130f02ce59)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'larger-batch-ctr' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"larger-batch-ctr","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/larger-batch-ctr"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/larger-batch-ctr/MAL-2024-10636.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/larger-batch-ctr"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:06:52.489630167Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:06:05Z","sha256":"db4300765f1658c2aea7cd741a96b021a92337dbb97807c037e67e130f02ce59","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/larger-batch-ctr","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.163551151Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"9b6b046a55684780d0609349b820dbf03562e5a7c358958288dd3a8b413eeb70","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/larger-batch-ctr","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.345347386Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"656e9c562903fe04cc05fafcf53492252e227e586138c11099ab475fcde70aee","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/larger-batch-ctr","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.471845932Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"90239b7046a6028321dce6c59adf07d39cf4d65199b496f01162cc09ea7b9457","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
