Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (77ef87ae43c8cdead9e7f7007e26a12949eb5cc8f8f59a27b78e2154186cde0a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'baibitmf' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"baibitmf","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/baibitmf"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/baibitmf/MAL-2024-10365.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/baibitmf"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T09:05:33.389648258Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:40:58Z","sha256":"77ef87ae43c8cdead9e7f7007e26a12949eb5cc8f8f59a27b78e2154186cde0a","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/baibitmf","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.874214843Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b74025ebaf8a47feec1e7a759e428fc0c4a5e2eadc023a37d7d7d70474744d3e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/baibitmf","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.057740215Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"8d93b26a0f284c5d1c8c947e71598235be7de5ec89c7da775b88d410436e33ae","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/baibitmf","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.197138672Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"f86d9c1003ae52d67fbf99627848f883b379fd46f02d62e270f8e79f450ffe05","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
