Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (c2d2c0992436650a40d64d021e56094cc48a801a15c5afaa60771bdc9e464f7e)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'oclip' @ 92.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"oclip","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/oclip"},"versions":["92.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/oclip/MAL-2024-10594.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/oclip"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T08:06:53.57877857Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T07:43:45Z","sha256":"c2d2c0992436650a40d64d021e56094cc48a801a15c5afaa60771bdc9e464f7e","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["92.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/oclip","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.262354563Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"0ef6501552dd6585f5c9189fdee9b7158e1e351fa6ac98be4048baa5129c7584","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/oclip","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.447746559Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"dc21e51bf306056c1f7386f6e7baeeec043f05fad768571f28624da41dd7b038","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/oclip","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.562021583Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"9d807179a533664d17e51887f6d21b0f0a8ecc444fee2cb216ee46168d7989fa","source":"kam193","versions":["92.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
