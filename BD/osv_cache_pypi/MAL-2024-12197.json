It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7"},"versions":["0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7/MAL-2024-12197.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.916253088Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"27776d2a3af6ace1d44128f9ec8a83b2bf6b9444e938370cf922576484cb16e5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.957244123Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"7acac602c6445456648e5d2df157f8b6085f8fb7fa4f001ec1d9fffd97da3294","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2387cbf7","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.260605925Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"4ac099efe3fc08e97b89a443bf402d03f44d0ee0b683f885223957ed11b3bd73","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
