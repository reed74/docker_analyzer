There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - exfiltration-cloud-tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tcloud-python-test","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/tcloud-python-test"},"versions":["1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/tcloud-python-test/MAL-2025-3006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-TCLOUDPYTHONTEST-12201353"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/tcloud-python-test"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2025-02005","import_time":"2025-03-31T07:07:06.980236897Z","modified_time":"2025-03-28T13:06:22Z","sha256":"b4be4b1ed6050855e2f9c6b1bfa0a9cd4c34a16211339ae604603d0e6aed6ba1","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["1.0.0"]},{"id":"RLUA-2025-04811","import_time":"2025-09-26T11:06:10.935474543Z","modified_time":"2025-09-26T09:14:39Z","sha256":"5852c723e0b065d1baa10c7bf39fcc721dc7670afb0d2b0e6a2b3cdfb2ec75ca","source":"reversing-labs"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/tcloud-python-test","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.629158524Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"dfd60357d0f2edeef38c986940b03ad4707313ad64a7ff32fa9a7e6140b08f28","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/tcloud-python-test","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:18.670693612Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"221affa8a84428ae21f288ce299d114742d269e7bbcbf223a0aa666327fae2c4","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/tcloud-python-test","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.857154991Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","sha256":"d59dfeaf84ba550b8e71f5efae21f11364439f657c8e1c4d47c57b5f8609ca13","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.0"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
