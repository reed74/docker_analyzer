There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - exfiltration-cloud-tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"snapshot-photo","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/snapshot-photo"},"versions":["0.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/snapshot-photo/MAL-2025-191871.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/snapshot-photo"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/snapshot-photo","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.57989082Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"51f6cfdc6cf4953adad6f0d2eb04668ee7c505e7cbce7076c0313b8882e4d194","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/snapshot-photo","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:18.624989132Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"61ed09e2fa2143dedd945c585d917ad8d7b55d7118e5093430b48c5c02d126f8","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/snapshot-photo","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.820334119Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","sha256":"bcf303eecb263c63c9b73015f4d18ad34711dbca624aa0f694e1e5a84366b05e","source":"kam193","versions":["0.0.3"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
