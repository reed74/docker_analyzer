Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (cb1d2f963982b051c70a7149ccd500d8e39c022b77ea0da9a8bfeb10959bf8e8)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'x2vml-gml' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"x2vml-gml","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/x2vml-gml"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/x2vml-gml/MAL-2024-10363.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/x2vml-gml"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T08:37:06.437426723Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:31:10Z","sha256":"cb1d2f963982b051c70a7149ccd500d8e39c022b77ea0da9a8bfeb10959bf8e8","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/x2vml-gml","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.5147427Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"92b440ba96c48a325519085edfc8c7b4f5a5438a9a9a51f65dd377ca2bb88c89","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/x2vml-gml","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.698721853Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"c0a24139221a012c1dcb193331f49469571c2400d49c53489603dd68b26698e6","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/x2vml-gml","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.786223581Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"e2876f88cd0afb5bc23f986e72bc49ece9bf15e367344924060f1bb76a99ddff","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
