Package targets a typo in the Binance documentation:  https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/blob/f1703c54c3059423a8568b2300597210b19b938e/clients/rebate/docs/migration_guide_rebate_sdk.md\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"binance-sdk-ebate","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/binance-sdk-ebate"},"versions":["10.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/binance-sdk-ebate/MAL-2025-47747.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/binance-sdk-ebate"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2025-04746","import_time":"2025-09-26T11:05:31.285364324Z","modified_time":"2025-09-26T09:13:45Z","sha256":"8c6df72dfa3549c1d5f204b74c7ddea64781cedd2b93ee103698a72b587e1301","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["10.0.0"]},{"id":"pypi/GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest/binance-sdk-ebate","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.885812958Z","modified_time":"2025-08-18T19:44:10.239927Z","sha256":"00215dfec61ee883c8bdcaf36ceda21926774db797421144e2cb673eb30956f7","source":"kam193","versions":["10.0.0"]},{"id":"pypi/GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest/binance-sdk-ebate","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.069863061Z","modified_time":"2025-08-18T19:44:10.239927Z","sha256":"43db9ff01b53b59066c74bb7571e281c1364444174851bd25c272e8fd7f3f503","source":"kam193","versions":["10.0.0"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
