Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (d7d88e4a49c08d9f895084d8191e23c3a88c26396f41fb3356ba7a5134659aef)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'open-clips-torch' @ 95.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"open-clips-torch","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/open-clips-torch"},"versions":["95.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/open-clips-torch/MAL-2024-10720.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/open-clips-torch"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-15T08:37:48.520351033Z","modified_time":"2024-11-15T08:31:08Z","sha256":"d7d88e4a49c08d9f895084d8191e23c3a88c26396f41fb3356ba7a5134659aef","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["95.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/open-clips-torch","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.271760241Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"51427fd13627790244c20595c056357e1143ada57d5d969d47923fa9568bf1d5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/open-clips-torch","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.458179704Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"10d9dac2d506ba155492c5ada78ed91eb05119b7dda57f12c0d34c878c543aeb","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/open-clips-torch","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.57146304Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"1380b85689a21388d38481ba5783efac2b248ffeaa28dd49e2aa1cc563d0214d","source":"kam193","versions":["95.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
