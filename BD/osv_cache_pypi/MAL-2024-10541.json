Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (af3f7688132b6b9f4516d3ba60dff758a89f1a24357a1fee3d891758acac385d)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d' @ 0.1.2 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d"},"versions":["0.1.2","0.1.1","0.1.3","0.1.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d/MAL-2024-10541.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-09T21:04:55.817842118Z","modified_time":"2024-11-09T20:45:55Z","sha256":"af3f7688132b6b9f4516d3ba60dff758a89f1a24357a1fee3d891758acac385d","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.1.2"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.925157325Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"d4da56f540937f93fe5ed06d33bb06e36c4716391883d106904dfc44ae82030c","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.96525035Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"dfb249857a1fcf0c79636d8692dc8b148d847336022dbe6f4ab558f6f5c2f97f","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.269581317Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"578195b3a8c390f043e7bec8cb2300f758bb3988a062038ffb23c2af4ed34dda","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
