It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d"},"versions":["0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d/MAL-2024-12196.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.915466283Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"eef2f889663cc64ccbec29ef7c92266ec28f3770538a0bdbd5fe2500c133652d","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.956533508Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"fee5bd32875c77b424ebb9a32f5c20b4dbfa892c17655622ba445be401db32d4","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2387a34d","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.259739841Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"d1b476253d782436595bb7dd46b9d2406663b74581302b6f0d1200dbf02cb84e","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
