Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (371d7b07c707020440571763794aac9cad128d41e9874fa3b0b069c758dccaf2)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'dbt-bytedhouse' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dbt-bytedhouse","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/dbt-bytedhouse"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/dbt-bytedhouse/MAL-2024-10413.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/dbt-bytedhouse"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-06T08:37:40.112535728Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T08:21:31Z","sha256":"371d7b07c707020440571763794aac9cad128d41e9874fa3b0b069c758dccaf2","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dbt-bytedhouse","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.977392949Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"c680049c4efacd00ce3f1fcaa8d2796b3f8ff73cfb6a0dab5086f4c249ae052b","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dbt-bytedhouse","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.170897862Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"ebd5ea76dc950b3bfb5104cd6cc0fd93024e297adad76ab02e0d5842c4777628","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dbt-bytedhouse","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.310123587Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"097deda413dcf3f88db7d138c35a6accb39fd65a685c6fe822a2b9f0dfa0cdce","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
