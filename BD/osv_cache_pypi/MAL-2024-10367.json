Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (02468ca2a6c6786284502b294e1d557b03baf8779034cba7c4df205dc77bd710)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'bytesap' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bytesap","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/bytesap"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/bytesap/MAL-2024-10367.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/bytesap"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T09:05:33.955679519Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T09:02:28Z","sha256":"02468ca2a6c6786284502b294e1d557b03baf8779034cba7c4df205dc77bd710","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytesap","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.91670568Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"27b62bd72c276d049d4db9911bb7328b28efe070719ddc44b8f1aabd0e710bdd","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytesap","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.108041912Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"4eec30f2d541d35548fef109eb76c972e92203c749f615aa08f976fb9b0c2a03","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytesap","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.239875721Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"686beacf1d7da2468af1104d62aabdba48560976b04eb39b5cb533a67918d000","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
