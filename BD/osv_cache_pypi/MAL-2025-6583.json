There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - exfiltration-cloud-tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"serverkeeper-verifier","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/serverkeeper-verifier"},"versions":["1.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/serverkeeper-verifier/MAL-2025-6583.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/serverkeeper-verifier"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2025-03682","import_time":"2025-08-01T10:07:13.733004792Z","modified_time":"2025-07-31T19:16:24Z","sha256":"057bf5e05699ba2f3ef1bb184b416c68f23932258fbd8dd47e02a9190b17484b","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["1.0.1"]},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/serverkeeper-verifier","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.570119498Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"94f6a91a9f56d1123737d8f434748eaeb7f4ec0025b593e4a244b55e40ac9d33","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/serverkeeper-verifier","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:18.611976471Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"62ec235d314e175928f82504dade8d7f8313bc88707038976e5be6d78709b869","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/serverkeeper-verifier","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.812359893Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","sha256":"c3177977a0e995a54237cc44b9cd9f97921d9bb0d78e49d501931fefd2bbc703","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
