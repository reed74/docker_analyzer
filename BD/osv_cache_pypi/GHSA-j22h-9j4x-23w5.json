This could allow tool calls to operate on other repositories accessible to the server process. The fix adds path validation that resolves both the configured repository and the requested path (following symlinks) and verifies the requested path is within the allowed repository before executing any git operations. Users are advised to upgrade to 2025.12.18 to remediate this issue.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/yardenporat for reporting.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mcp-server-git","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/mcp-server-git"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2025.12.18"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","2025.1.14","2025.11.25","2025.7.1","2025.9.25"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-j22h-9j4x-23w5/GHSA-j22h-9j4x-23w5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/security/advisories/GHSA-j22h-9j4x-23w5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68145"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-17T22:50:38Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-17T23:16:04Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N"}]}
