The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"transformers","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/transformers"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.49.0"},{"fixed":"4.51.0"}]}],"versions":["4.49.0","4.50.0","4.50.1","4.50.2","4.50.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-489j-g2vx-39wf/GHSA-489j-g2vx-39wf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3262"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/0720e206c6ba28887e4d60ef60a6a089f6c1cc76"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/126abe3461762e5fc180e7e614391d1b4ab051ca"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/ecf5ccc4-39e7-4fb3-b547-14a41d31a184"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-07T23:44:56Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-07T10:15:27Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
