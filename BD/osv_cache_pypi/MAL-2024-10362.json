Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (306e631bb2dc6de5a2bbb8b52c4a21b676d75bbde9029919bbbf642a5e2584b3)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'v2xlm-gml' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"v2xlm-gml","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/v2xlm-gml"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/v2xlm-gml/MAL-2024-10362.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/v2xlm-gml"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T08:37:06.108186605Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:30:41Z","sha256":"306e631bb2dc6de5a2bbb8b52c4a21b676d75bbde9029919bbbf642a5e2584b3","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/v2xlm-gml","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.487135392Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"d777eeb5bc446a53f27f01e43cc2e293e0c74f1a76e4d174f8a5e2c4e4cb7a47","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/v2xlm-gml","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.668129673Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"7fbdd4767b759c720bb13db759299986734471ff1064c52f7d25110c8e9aa617","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/v2xlm-gml","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.764249526Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"8c9f705cfd389777ff407d89226cadaa60917e6174934dff866d61c89fd8a1db","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
