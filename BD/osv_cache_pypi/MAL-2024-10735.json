Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (e459b598ce8eb554b98b0588fb5bc8832f0c7aaa2eb21ab5f21ce2c259c15358)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'controlnot-aux' @ 95.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"controlnot-aux","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/controlnot-aux"},"versions":["95.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/controlnot-aux/MAL-2024-10735.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/controlnot-aux"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-15T10:06:11.156273813Z","modified_time":"2024-11-15T09:41:13Z","sha256":"e459b598ce8eb554b98b0588fb5bc8832f0c7aaa2eb21ab5f21ce2c259c15358","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["95.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/controlnot-aux","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.962988538Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"f0876ca676919b02cc500e4d94e0a69332e38dc1da44abaab8b049db65cfadd1","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/controlnot-aux","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.153060977Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a99770ef01fb53c863387ed64967ab6ed42be0cf7c901573dcd472db6ae51091","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/controlnot-aux","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.291980382Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"00c041739cfad76e588f560e16814004ede2c5a1f1b3ae0699b82bf6240cafea","source":"kam193","versions":["95.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
