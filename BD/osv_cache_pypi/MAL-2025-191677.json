There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - exfiltration-cloud-tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"alicloud-client-sdk","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/alicloud-client-sdk"},"versions":["1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/alicloud-client-sdk/MAL-2025-191677.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/alicloud-client-sdk"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/alicloud-client-sdk","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.896962307Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"68c2f04be7ad1e555d333c26d7f356217bc8290f4fcda4b1f7a8fb7ace6040fc","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/alicloud-client-sdk","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.941182785Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"59563b61e548ff83488a4940e0511825ebf1a2d0995c83e0056e07fd7a4bd782","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/alicloud-client-sdk","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.24779189Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","sha256":"27c974fe93b58e128d4e488e48ac74e5d331ed010a1572f2ab37ca2a3f2d1dd0","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.0"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"}]}
