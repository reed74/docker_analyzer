Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (aefb518974135eb466833c5ca5eba8804ce30a3771fb23eb70a4cab52747e544)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'pyyal' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pyyal","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/pyyal"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/pyyal/MAL-2024-10646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/pyyal"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:37:35.085031565Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:10:53Z","sha256":"aefb518974135eb466833c5ca5eba8804ce30a3771fb23eb70a4cab52747e544","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/pyyal","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.350575433Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"90fe0f11c862b8e01ae2f2c40b4f59ba5af374816d6f7ecb36c450f1f5fefdf8","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/pyyal","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.542430433Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"85587f160dc4e7bcc19305fd294a77bf8256a3efb5e70b8ec84c94994edfb2a5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/pyyal","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.644880977Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"cf2f052953a644525907ca6a3800679a378b82cc28878ec09e05253651dc58db","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
