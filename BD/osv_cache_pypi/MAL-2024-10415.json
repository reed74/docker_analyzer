Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (27a48b1de47cd1b40c058ec3e933c1eeca55ab8df067c2a7bc854f95c80a7aa3)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'dtb-bytehouse' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dtb-bytehouse","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/dtb-bytehouse"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/dtb-bytehouse/MAL-2024-10415.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/dtb-bytehouse"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-06T08:37:39.658730511Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T08:17:46Z","sha256":"27a48b1de47cd1b40c058ec3e933c1eeca55ab8df067c2a7bc854f95c80a7aa3","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dtb-bytehouse","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.003943325Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"5252535511063b5a7b1133012ad319ad916aa78ce77ba18dc8d4270893ed1472","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dtb-bytehouse","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.202421675Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"06aa48470385547ee5492235e09e67a4e05dc26e55ea6e59c023d4726f9b20c7","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dtb-bytehouse","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.339828421Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"5ecb7c7f4b0beab6010b98366d67dd547b18762cb7deff263d4e803e89f18cd7","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
