Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (5fcabb1647d6f878da4ef221a57ed73cdf7a38ef567fce4e3c8da3e6db8f3275)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'bytemlperf' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bytemlperf","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/bytemlperf"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/bytemlperf/MAL-2024-10446.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/bytemlperf"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:30.675783529Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:53Z","sha256":"5fcabb1647d6f878da4ef221a57ed73cdf7a38ef567fce4e3c8da3e6db8f3275","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytemlperf","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.909968229Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"1e4334c3b371ca89a45380a47378fec036f6722cf7d1733227d26077aa7288e9","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytemlperf","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.100700614Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"abcc70611e2d35cabe7d6a6f7e88ff8f9fab7d9e2a42b0fc3c0d1f036c8582be","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytemlperf","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.232003907Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"c1936b1ced3e98007a447da325fc9924615d6c70b2721fb54743983e5a5a1610","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
