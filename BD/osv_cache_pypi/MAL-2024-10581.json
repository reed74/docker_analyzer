Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (a04615a460dd00248444677f7a06288c3f9fe9228bd54cb573b9860ce3c18a8e)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'ic-flow-platform' @ 91.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ic-flow-platform","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/ic-flow-platform"},"versions":["91.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/ic-flow-platform/MAL-2024-10581.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/ic-flow-platform"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T03:35:54.342271004Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T03:30:51Z","sha256":"a04615a460dd00248444677f7a06288c3f9fe9228bd54cb573b9860ce3c18a8e","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["91.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/ic-flow-platform","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.113012179Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"d337568f660021a1f525132d4983286cc712dcf07910e5fa2ce2672dd8e9394f","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/ic-flow-platform","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.300509612Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"083c1a7beb41abdd8e33841c034133e42f802c4f7de64e47815c139f65023b0e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/ic-flow-platform","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.433275678Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"298469816f1f12a1fad2cab82c128ba9d2b5c14a1d5f1d137b0e8d6ca06582f3","source":"kam193","versions":["91.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
