Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (c3f8249684bf7b77429ca0e1f687e151959b9a8f2783b500b6b625163f136d57)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'paws-room-acoustics-simulator' @ 99.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"paws-room-acoustics-simulator","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/paws-room-acoustics-simulator"},"versions":["99.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/paws-room-acoustics-simulator/MAL-2024-10828.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/paws-room-acoustics-simulator"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-19T07:05:38.154919574Z","modified_time":"2024-11-19T06:51:02Z","sha256":"c3f8249684bf7b77429ca0e1f687e151959b9a8f2783b500b6b625163f136d57","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/paws-room-acoustics-simulator","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.289406178Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"32f6a48aa5acf1f6dccdbd938f720b6eaf3d1aea2f7f95db8cea1887aef32e91","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/paws-room-acoustics-simulator","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.476608897Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"445343e49b96223100e6e2d17e72f3cead8dedeeac8f6250e2b3b66b52c694e4","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/paws-room-acoustics-simulator","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.593643498Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"7dcc07cc5ab2e784f062fa36af5a7993385e74781e1439d4aab27895703e62ee","source":"kam193","versions":["99.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
