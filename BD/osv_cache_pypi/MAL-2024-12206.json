It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd"},"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd/MAL-2024-12206.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.938465685Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"41c953e35b41395121b18148e70d597bc4064dd74f50d21157852fb8aaab03f4","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.977855395Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a9387b7d87481e9cd5b097ef03cf94182d34336833057cca2ed1ea47914d55cb","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f70fc6dd","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.28304176Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"b342a2d856734679f3aacfb1c6d3ba500a967e71014a6015b380b5089cbc09e2","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
