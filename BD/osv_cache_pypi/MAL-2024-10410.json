Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (d71d9f551657daa910fa36b01308d70d2ec99253f6ee5243c5bf3f6adea1a899)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'bytedps' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bytedps","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/bytedps"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/bytedps/MAL-2024-10410.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/bytedps"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-06T08:37:38.885839117Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T08:10:59Z","sha256":"d71d9f551657daa910fa36b01308d70d2ec99253f6ee5243c5bf3f6adea1a899","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytedps","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.903887276Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"3cc3a500b368b7176465b13af5a7731a1badf88f4311b92abf176e7b5c4a21d6","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytedps","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.092883121Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"89403fd14357b9969879ed80062b26ab63de5566bf285532ffa46382f1886e7c","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bytedps","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.222867958Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"67bd2fe23a4ead6db5a9c33e31d9c4eabbc040a0da4dfcff87a9fa61dd03f32d","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
