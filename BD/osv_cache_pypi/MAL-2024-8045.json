Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (3f0f6a9c42db8cd0225145791163af3328e846517ea2677afe6de139ca856c82)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738' @ 0.3.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738"},"versions":["0.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738/MAL-2024-8045.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-27T16:05:20.365393384Z","modified_time":"2024-08-27T15:50:43Z","sha256":"3f0f6a9c42db8cd0225145791163af3328e846517ea2677afe6de139ca856c82","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.3.1"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.933658922Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"7e49a9f10a6355c4954923769353f686559d6bd1bc7f1c51b2a78ec5811bb848","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.973299788Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"5da429dcc2bd3c0de786f149b4b510b2aebb23e894f5eaea3f80812b8241dd6a","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-ccd28738","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.278185116Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"2be1953afa819144ec4a354a0a7134db81fcf0974b5d0238cbd18d3812ff6944","source":"kam193","versions":["0.3.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
