Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest?

It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (ea4ad64262117d14ebd3029a5ec84a28c624cb2ed58c5a94f1b8749a7c6d304a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4' @ 0.1.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4"},"versions":["0.1.1","0.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4/MAL-2024-8023.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-15T14:05:08.780270678Z","modified_time":"2024-08-15T14:00:51Z","sha256":"ea4ad64262117d14ebd3029a5ec84a28c624cb2ed58c5a94f1b8749a7c6d304a","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.1.1"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.932042782Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"11753813459a50b38a60e4010791a22313e9b79e4d534fd4f13f968bb158e74b","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.971646974Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"0239eb42a339ea04c20285cf4f4fd719e841f19d6e59a2cbb78f6e982fcea446","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b6920ef4","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.276557923Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"76145c2fbc5eebba4459660fbff5bfa2da1acf49e652ea8db9703a1f2f770cef","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.2","0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
