Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (02276d47d8678bd06955da62ecdcb763c5ae107ba0b8674171a97c672ed79be0)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'textharmony' @ 99.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"textharmony","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/textharmony"},"versions":["99.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/textharmony/MAL-2024-10830.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/textharmony"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-19T07:05:38.021471678Z","modified_time":"2024-11-19T06:40:54Z","sha256":"02276d47d8678bd06955da62ecdcb763c5ae107ba0b8674171a97c672ed79be0","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/textharmony","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.452366317Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"6de22bdd960486e01d3085611afa5085bd74fb9724bfb11bfece3581452d3aca","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/textharmony","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.636455353Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a225b73c6a06e67b7911b74dae2bd28201575919bbcfe2cde0ad1a2a0b57aee6","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/textharmony","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.738123111Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"2f0553b831612978b23abde1b6560b6628b2a8fb76071a2a3e8e9c82a9f0cbce","source":"kam193","versions":["99.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
