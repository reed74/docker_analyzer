Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (722f249a7c80943794d638256a7fcbff6862e6194de05f36862b7ec9d54b8fab)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'feddecor' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"feddecor","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/feddecor"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/feddecor/MAL-2024-10633.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/feddecor"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:06:52.2878322Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:05:57Z","sha256":"722f249a7c80943794d638256a7fcbff6862e6194de05f36862b7ec9d54b8fab","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/feddecor","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.039152667Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"444a24e241df3ba2b50f83bc08c26ab7da2966be8501f390454bee0a53d32453","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/feddecor","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.230897469Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"d57b7181cccb8b8ac72e0505c24b6e11f7bf6dcc2018c32bb89bb4379ad243ff","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/feddecor","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.372034303Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"05db29e83ab14e20e2f9493b8cdab2601c35c327954dadac16dab8c8e8926446","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
