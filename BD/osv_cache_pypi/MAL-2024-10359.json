Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9e37088f8f32c7b691763a6fcebb9140127c0e4d3d659df84f9b48172284c282)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'lightseqe' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lightseqe","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/lightseqe"},"versions":["99.7","98.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/lightseqe/MAL-2024-10359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/lightseqe"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T08:37:05.843979714Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:16:03Z","sha256":"9e37088f8f32c7b691763a6fcebb9140127c0e4d3d659df84f9b48172284c282","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/lightseqe","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.17553845Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"217942ae609e52ff0694e2b0e666adfcc6841f5d5f3353aa69e3c565febb76a4","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/lightseqe","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.357532242Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"6f3ebdee7f587049da541169c6218b3bade3e1ce54144846f1f16c39fa8594d6","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/lightseqe","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.482562007Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"2f42f950b1e84d97209558a679c9351f74eb5777dd3d2287caa8acb5af423109","source":"kam193","versions":["98.7","99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
