There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - exfiltration-cloud-tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"timekeeper-verifier","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/timekeeper-verifier"},"versions":["1.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/timekeeper-verifier/MAL-2025-3475.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/timekeeper-verifier"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2025-02542","import_time":"2025-04-25T09:36:48.887586289Z","modified_time":"2025-04-23T16:06:46Z","sha256":"87005aaa82cdcdac0a0d4c6d36e67ac25608db01d8ed2d87dcb8c62b7137fde1","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["1.0.1"]},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/timekeeper-verifier","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.6504489Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"226cb0f9a178aab0334014940359365a2cb5a328b5762c735095bbec28847942","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/timekeeper-verifier","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:18.693188627Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"3a20fe9fed2445d097ddfd628d59e1b8149913aec4915c112cacfa9fb7cdfc6e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/timekeeper-verifier","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.878135783Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","sha256":"82c37c5db80adcf285cdf43663d4e49d0d77ea76f9d07372bbffcca5d8333fd7","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
