Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9b971d40eca1cceb8d27177313771f0e256bd017027471a0b6cbddebd9ed0687)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744' @ 0.3.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744"},"versions":["0.3.1","0.3.2","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.3.0","2.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744/MAL-2024-8044.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-27T15:34:13.231494818Z","modified_time":"2024-08-27T15:25:47Z","sha256":"9b971d40eca1cceb8d27177313771f0e256bd017027471a0b6cbddebd9ed0687","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.3.1"]},{"import_time":"2024-08-27T15:34:13.320298554Z","modified_time":"2024-08-27T15:33:15Z","sha256":"a6294573a4b592f105492275dd21bdca52de1b6d59415f62196661552dd70cb5","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.3.2"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.918177801Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"c42a6021135e58bd2d38611b42736f3085582d51bfba66c76583593b798b77a9","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.958854618Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"0c03451c46b9f1a6e1a2ad4df4b3919782e86a4879fa78b7967ae7ec3e694645","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.262224342Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"bbde1f7b0bcb8d3f3aee469b17277097f08fd0c76f679eb18c0a2510e9b5e2bc","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.3.2","2.0.0","0.3.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
