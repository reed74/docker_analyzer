Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (7258a47f8f122c383bed49ae4cb068169e5430f2406973ecc407eb443f03ac97)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'openfermionpyscaf' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openfermionpyscaf","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/openfermionpyscaf"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/openfermionpyscaf/MAL-2024-10643.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/openfermionpyscaf"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:37:35.749998359Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:21:04Z","sha256":"7258a47f8f122c383bed49ae4cb068169e5430f2406973ecc407eb443f03ac97","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/openfermionpyscaf","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.27284628Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"056d42d075a3e6da52a37c15048240eadc4514c4a5a90f6b43d1d559dad5b0c7","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/openfermionpyscaf","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.459437125Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"80e1ad166d90cdc9eab4e68a7e939f6087b6c9c657f5f2c78626e76810a5ac53","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/openfermionpyscaf","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.572739868Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"5b2a2df521dda697ce4ffa1bedeb62fd388ba4229ab3823cc11fdcc87c57d553","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
