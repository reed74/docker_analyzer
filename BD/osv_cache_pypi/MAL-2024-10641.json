Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (4b118556da9e2bba947c48d051cc3cc78b284506ed69b69d2d314bc65e79e6d6)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'libbmet' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libbmet","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/libbmet"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/libbmet/MAL-2024-10641.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/libbmet"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:37:36.070524652Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:25:53Z","sha256":"4b118556da9e2bba947c48d051cc3cc78b284506ed69b69d2d314bc65e79e6d6","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/libbmet","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.167948148Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"0c2771bea8300dc3fd9b78acb53cb02255828cdaa0e6f60714e3c855664516e3","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/libbmet","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.349755717Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"12e210851a01148bf8927296b30371a140cc028880e07ff392e76c404f2ba3ac","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/libbmet","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.477256756Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"ac65dcd563d06fc1bbec2395b43f3c2d110d2b217e1b1ead96e79509a3d15f8a","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
