Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (ad9960d8f8c7e3409679b949bfbfbb9eec23354563e5af20930235fe8f6efc58)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'deepsolid' @ 99.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deepsolid","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/deepsolid"},"versions":["99.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/deepsolid/MAL-2024-10821.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/deepsolid"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-19T07:05:38.918454872Z","modified_time":"2024-11-19T07:02:36Z","sha256":"ad9960d8f8c7e3409679b949bfbfbb9eec23354563e5af20930235fe8f6efc58","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/deepsolid","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.985408096Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"4172aeb7bdbd7c050b411c8fa27ad2a59fcf5cb65d4e049d0944a04998495b4d","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/deepsolid","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.179679847Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"bd495f31431e621d5ce9440e408d5b86e69cf6545ab1cff1eff26ff87b0a4d08","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/deepsolid","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.320469737Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"4770b5cf7e9e664a6225148d94fc040feeaafe0f7a13bf3efc9969999f3da077","source":"kam193","versions":["99.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
