Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (af0484bb217b7ddd004e70636121d72502d2f1cb891813befd59accc172d5b9d)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'huggingfaces-hub' @ 95.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"huggingfaces-hub","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/huggingfaces-hub"},"versions":["95.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/huggingfaces-hub/MAL-2024-10728.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/huggingfaces-hub"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-15T09:35:13.285148561Z","modified_time":"2024-11-15T09:21:00Z","sha256":"af0484bb217b7ddd004e70636121d72502d2f1cb891813befd59accc172d5b9d","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["95.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/huggingfaces-hub","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.103449588Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"c9d19f0ddad2b6d58448ac78c86818442db5643cd3067486de2aff318b29b876","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/huggingfaces-hub","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.291052632Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"030324e12766820002cc282dbac28f60bb0f2fc82d459e96c82f073a14e75592","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/huggingfaces-hub","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.430058298Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"9ca997255317a80120e07701813ac7266c6d07db1b9fbb6fc612ff84ff1cb990","source":"kam193","versions":["95.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
