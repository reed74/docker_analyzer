Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (febb0ae91d31731d573a6aa77d05686bcf7419fc07fc038f24b5e1b55aec6644)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'adandv' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"adandv","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/adandv"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/adandv/MAL-2024-10580.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/adandv"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T03:35:54.162822375Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T03:26:07Z","sha256":"febb0ae91d31731d573a6aa77d05686bcf7419fc07fc038f24b5e1b55aec6644","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/adandv","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.821857171Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"0b4add6ee3e6aefaa462873791f5c91fbe3d236f25a5ef804cd0de66ce7330ea","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/adandv","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.000495979Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"fa4c35a5e7c5de24d29d3ccc2378bc8f5a64dc95c1a101df612ef9be69fc4ca5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/adandv","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.148823445Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"353d60d233a88785ca4492eaf492a84a3361d9bd3ce7881dd169ebee1fe3d6e8","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
