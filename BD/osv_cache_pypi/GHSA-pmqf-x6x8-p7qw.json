However, the model would then only accept text, defeating the purpose of using a multi-modal model.\n\n### Resolution\n\n- https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27204","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vllm","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/vllm"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0.5.5"},{"fixed":"0.11.1"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.1.1","0.10.2","0.11.0","0.5.5","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.1.post1","0.6.1.post2","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.3.post1","0.6.4","0.6.4.post1","0.6.5","0.6.6","0.6.6.post1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.8.5.post1","0.9.0","0.9.0.1","0.9.1","0.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-pmqf-x6x8-p7qw/GHSA-pmqf-x6x8-p7qw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-pmqf-x6x8-p7qw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62372"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27204"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/6613"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/58fab50d82838d5014f4a14d991fdb9352c9c84b"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-129"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-20T21:23:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-21T02:15:43Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H"}]}
