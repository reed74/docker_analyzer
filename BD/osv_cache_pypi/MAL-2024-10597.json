Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (a80cd9d2c299ab298d753637d18ed260c3270fabd2b99ed8ac6bbe98b0f66cf9)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'para-gen' @ 93.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"para-gen","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/para-gen"},"versions":["93.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/para-gen/MAL-2024-10597.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/para-gen"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T08:06:53.097582Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T07:43:25Z","sha256":"a80cd9d2c299ab298d753637d18ed260c3270fabd2b99ed8ac6bbe98b0f66cf9","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["93.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/para-gen","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.288536834Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"d3f77f7bc8393eca7ff2159d0e7fcbdb38e992125efa151ec63fb7b71ac06214","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/para-gen","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.475510453Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b3d08fbd0f121caa044ad303a9e0c91c40edb96d35166f220961b594eda2aea3","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/para-gen","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.592345819Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"22f7ee918be8bc17b2b6386bcb725ea7f08cfba43ee0761dddb01593b284bc72","source":"kam193","versions":["93.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
