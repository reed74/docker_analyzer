The vulnerability arises from the usage of `file_path = f\"{UPLOAD_DIR}/{file.filename}\"` without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the `file.filename` parameter to include directory traversal sequences, causing the resulting `file_path` to escape the intended `UPLOAD_DIR` and potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to unauthorized modifications of system binaries, configuration files, or sensitive data, potentially enabling remote command execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"open-webui","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/open-webui"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.3.8"}]}],"versions":["0.1.124","0.1.125","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","0.3.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-crh6-pj8c-xrhc/GHSA-crh6-pj8c-xrhc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7034"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/711beada-10fe-4567-9278-80a689da8613"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-21T17:30:06Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-20T10:15:35Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
