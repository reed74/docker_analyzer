Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (ee9de982f050cb2906cb58f9a7e13c20af350d093f901061240af152f27edd8d)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'nuest' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nuest","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/nuest"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/nuest/MAL-2024-10372.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/nuest"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T09:05:33.709705321Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:57:58Z","sha256":"ee9de982f050cb2906cb58f9a7e13c20af350d093f901061240af152f27edd8d","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/nuest","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.257147031Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"641c66342cb972e320b60d3a7ed161f28d7e06faee435b1c30c4558898f92552","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/nuest","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.442320347Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b492bc7bd440cf222a12c711590d7035a901a290bea145c0df822b55e57c0ebb","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/nuest","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.556101056Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"85e15976cd5c53ba0d3085f892dbaec0488cb9f04a14056b293e36065a4cdf43","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
