Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (974c3dd29aac6ad71fdd0dda8efd882f35ddc0b22f738a744cbe0cc35f946be0)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'mtvqa' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mtvqa","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/mtvqa"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/mtvqa/MAL-2024-10454.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/mtvqa"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:30.930741999Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T04:00:43Z","sha256":"974c3dd29aac6ad71fdd0dda8efd882f35ddc0b22f738a744cbe0cc35f946be0","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/mtvqa","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.222863548Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"c7d8629d19980a9f8212d22a34881b92140c7c759f1ac235dac3a1f320c1f996","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/mtvqa","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.406344708Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"6bbe70facb5d2fdcfcc26c8928fc4734338716f9b79d206ead385f8dacf4c260","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/mtvqa","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.530239586Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"99d1e279a66b99bf1f3957eac4e2683cccb516d5b3b5668780fe9c3a1e69bffb","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
