The maintainer states the following:\n\n> These CVEs are invalid. Knack is a CLI framework used by [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli). It's a local library, not a web service. In addition, the regex is used to extract function and parameter docstrings from the source code. It is not used to match user input. Therefore, it does not expose any attack surface. There is no way to use it for ReDoS attack.\n\nThis link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nMicrosoft Knack 0.12.0 allows Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the knack.introspection module (issue 1 of 2).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"knack","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/knack"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.12.0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.10.0","0.10.1","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.7.0","0.7.0rc1","0.7.0rc3","0.7.0rc4","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.8.0","0.8.0rc1","0.8.0rc2","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/08/GHSA-6fxp-p9mg-q64w/GHSA-6fxp-p9mg-q64w.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54363"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/knack/issues/281"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/knack/issues/281#issuecomment-3218922941"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/knack"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/microsoft-knack-python-package-regular-expression-dos"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-08-21T15:00:54Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-08-20T03:15:35Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
