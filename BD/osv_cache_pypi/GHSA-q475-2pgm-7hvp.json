The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a \"write-only\" model for sensitive values.\n\nIn Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.\n\nThis issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.\n\nUsers of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apache-airflow","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/apache-airflow"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.3"},{"fixed":"3.0.4"}]}],"versions":["3.0.3","3.0.4rc1","3.0.4rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-q475-2pgm-7hvp/GHSA-q475-2pgm-7hvp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54831"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/vblmfqtydrp5zgn2q8tj3slk5podxspf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/25/4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-213"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-26T14:54:17Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-09-26T08:15:38Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
