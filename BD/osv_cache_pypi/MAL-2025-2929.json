There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - exfiltration-cloud-tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"acloud-client","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/acloud-client"},"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/acloud-client/MAL-2025-2929.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-ACLOUDCLIENT-12201342"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/acloud-client"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2025-01927","import_time":"2025-03-31T07:07:04.279224028Z","modified_time":"2025-03-28T13:05:14Z","sha256":"8afb489b46a4e95c11871dd065c618b98b6ff82565c0c1b7decb2a0835c125e4","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1"]},{"id":"RLUA-2025-04742","import_time":"2025-09-26T11:06:09.882703014Z","modified_time":"2025-09-26T09:13:42Z","sha256":"a468d481d3efdbe0a84f9814bf6d236de3b81b2130c29d5ff2529d6bdb99136d","source":"reversing-labs"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/acloud-client","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.883075217Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"04172dc499bf944e284ffb4a9f4d39fd379030b2ecbf8eada5ba703de258c0c4","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/acloud-client","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.926110867Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"4900ca27e14ecb6f022a740bd420fa046084355344379dd21a2b59c53d1c95f1","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/acloud-client","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.235650788Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","sha256":"e5991c849c24976979baaed6c5f337f0aaf2275d2cc990c5ad67490d51ac9b3c","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
