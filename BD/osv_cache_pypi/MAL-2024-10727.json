Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9b93398e29b9d342c1401d2daa718f6cd0d56e8f9f7caa3a6c33cec141c5b671)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'huggingface-hubs' @ 95.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"huggingface-hubs","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/huggingface-hubs"},"versions":["95.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/huggingface-hubs/MAL-2024-10727.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/huggingface-hubs"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-15T09:35:13.495314804Z","modified_time":"2024-11-15T09:21:27Z","sha256":"9b93398e29b9d342c1401d2daa718f6cd0d56e8f9f7caa3a6c33cec141c5b671","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["95.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/huggingface-hubs","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.102386411Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"bd90c8b1f384c441e6eabdf50b2ef9a6c2c6647b20a802079ba30a32844a1668","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/huggingface-hubs","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.290024471Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"1d238b4266e7eb2a0fbda69d410f875e0625c30fcf79647d89c6e3358cbdcb55","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/huggingface-hubs","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.428752464Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"05bec213a6346fd4442097b3f336a76e2ba70cd1cb345394c1f6e21cde8e9a12","source":"kam193","versions":["95.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
