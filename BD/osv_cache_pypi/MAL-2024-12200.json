It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc"},"versions":["0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc/MAL-2024-12200.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.922515779Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b86b6240f982bd7892669deaa48479fbe8589df125c6991abe7cba8268485930","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.962937987Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"fb5b4138d768e7efb48da60b6d89cdb6d3e2b6dfd97a4848d38ea24ca106af84","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-438d82fc","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.26676139Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"9ed45f09efc7dce1cb09017b71658a1704ee8c910fe47aa8c759cf41ac0eb04a","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
