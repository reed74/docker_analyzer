Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (cd041a7ba2b7bfa8d6897be17e6506af4f85aeb346b864efca174b561d3189b0)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'adanbu' @ 92.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"adanbu","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/adanbu"},"versions":["92.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/adanbu/MAL-2024-10578.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/adanbu"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T03:35:54.246635055Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T03:26:14Z","sha256":"cd041a7ba2b7bfa8d6897be17e6506af4f85aeb346b864efca174b561d3189b0","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["92.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/adanbu","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.820105056Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"577f36e73a48d89bcc75d709ac78290d5cbabe49192c3f9bf934a1cd6d121925","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/adanbu","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:18.998545105Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b04d14831fc213fd7496512c984142a73dd29b775dc40dd2fd5be4f26e06af3c","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/adanbu","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.146805466Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"95c6c669d1191b67ae4b80a81c283fa0ad4a62cb2604127ee8001294248ae8f0","source":"kam193","versions":["92.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
