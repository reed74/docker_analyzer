It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package"},"versions":["0.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package/MAL-2024-12192.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.940144904Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"809c91504d44a3ce598ab73a97aa2e3e1240f99e181d423df52c4435816060b7","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.979505113Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"0c18a16c7c21d93a8819aed298f6691835b1a31546ca573eb94ce4265d4fb291","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.284794287Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"2267696fdb22e1cf79e1298164ce7a55084adb73838c14619949fd1ba2089391","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.2"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
