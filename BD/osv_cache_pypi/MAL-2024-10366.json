Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (7005ffaec95cc31abcaaeb83f468221bf3153463c2aa33a854e002777b429e70)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'bebitmf' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bebitmf","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/bebitmf"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/bebitmf/MAL-2024-10366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/bebitmf"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T09:05:33.32748387Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:40:57Z","sha256":"7005ffaec95cc31abcaaeb83f468221bf3153463c2aa33a854e002777b429e70","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bebitmf","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.879650772Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"442619d6f19257b284021fc4308abb9a47161708c5e1db5f18378b22cca465fc","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bebitmf","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.062925654Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"74b4aea64b0811889f65fa66cb611912e1ff91bb08f22d2e0b3b5c9b8a179a63","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/bebitmf","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.20202942Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"b29540928b8273afa57209aeb39f1ae9901b802bdb05bf13de29a0106dfbac3a","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
