Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (e81897b53f33c5966290d6436cbe9e8ea80f9947ade2f1d30b3823834c6687c9)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'compresai' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"compresai","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/compresai"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/compresai/MAL-2024-10637.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/compresai"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T08:37:35.490638289Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T08:11:09Z","sha256":"e81897b53f33c5966290d6436cbe9e8ea80f9947ade2f1d30b3823834c6687c9","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/compresai","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.957636376Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"46abf2bd7c596eca400954cdf772e10b44b7da0548d67bb468dc9c1b7cd3d127","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/compresai","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.146447905Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"eff61bf37f16806690cbf9520f29f4e65c1619fb07bf01ccbb8c3c830f501736","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/compresai","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.285934333Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"623fbfe1b3142c8db2f9badc216624ebcbc61a1efea4b8e6a3a8dba4ca1107e9","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
