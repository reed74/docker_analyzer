It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154"},"versions":["0.1.1","0.2.0","0.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154/MAL-2024-12201.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.926640234Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a9275fd2e66c3cb8a487653f1ee18af4d57e06ef38c44a1bebd97a4a783b2377","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.966954281Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"6790c3a13c932def9b7e72c49a9efc861f0d5ec5d3187d11097dd51c8bb5b236","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-77d0c154","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.271275085Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"09e0f485b7840fe87569a554c32b231f7eb6cda1230098d54c34f97107678929","source":"kam193","versions":["0.1.1","0.2.0","0.1.2"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
