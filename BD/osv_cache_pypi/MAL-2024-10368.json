Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (7fdf58bb52d6cfb8d315f818188217dfcb89c0a0e41bccbfe0f3c8f84aae0a98)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'byteseep' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"byteseep","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/byteseep"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/byteseep/MAL-2024-10368.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/byteseep"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T09:05:33.894872976Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T09:02:08Z","sha256":"7fdf58bb52d6cfb8d315f818188217dfcb89c0a0e41bccbfe0f3c8f84aae0a98","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/byteseep","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.917709206Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"bafb275cbe083942001a3d4fd5320f368545b9487a52c333f5fa5f6882955c68","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/byteseep","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.109103035Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"dcee5204a425aa98a98071c8eee88e547f7570e05c72c9e18f01477a0b044794","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/byteseep","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.241053657Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"fe2c0a27ee9289e39ee2df89c5d0b16d9b206ad2f72543287400563c6d25ddae","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
