Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (afd6ea9666bf6ceb788814bf97d1d4e04d9d20bc715624d139e2da921b61c2d5)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'decompopt' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"decompopt","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/decompopt"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/decompopt/MAL-2024-10448.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/decompopt"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:29.716953328Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:44Z","sha256":"afd6ea9666bf6ceb788814bf97d1d4e04d9d20bc715624d139e2da921b61c2d5","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/decompopt","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.981929507Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"cb113977b7a82bf82c87ca9dcea074f4285d5c70cd12cc78954671dec794f3a8","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/decompopt","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.175829576Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"2ff4de2c6f71744da4762614ad0593338aaaef2896c69bc16a2d81d2faaca1f8","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/decompopt","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.316336043Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"702fac0aaf49fa4ee1a06ed3a95e656595af8fb64b87bc6ab51026c1ddf3ba31","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
