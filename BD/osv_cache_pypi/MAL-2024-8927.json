Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (043b6fb01e7b449df3f0e98cea17d14f5ff23562b501dcc19cc344cd88de1e93)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a' @ 0.1.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a"},"versions":["0.1.1","1.0.1","1.0.0","1.0.2","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a/MAL-2024-8927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-09-21T02:46:14.356225892Z","modified_time":"2024-09-21T02:35:45Z","sha256":"043b6fb01e7b449df3f0e98cea17d14f5ff23562b501dcc19cc344cd88de1e93","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.1.1"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.935365483Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"7aaa12f0b41cafb62e04932cd9e0af65fc68b6c7568a50245cd34f0b8a60d688","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.974826075Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"ba3dfc0be54b4fdd3d2d352e658210ad3d22d1108a4d1406320394a55e498f10","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-db7d716a","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.279820965Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"f42bbe8dfcac4b369decd44858ed5b8e5e202fe3c281eeb3b0bcea9b9068b108","source":"kam193","versions":["1.0.1","1.0.0","1.0.2","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","0.1.1"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
