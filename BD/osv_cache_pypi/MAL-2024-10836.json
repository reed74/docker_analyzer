Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (db8050330a14ea0cbafdbba285a6f38ad157a4477e866ffc82f60f96b83437d1)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'offline-rl-congestion-control' @ 99.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"offline-rl-congestion-control","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/offline-rl-congestion-control"},"versions":["99.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/offline-rl-congestion-control/MAL-2024-10836.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/offline-rl-congestion-control"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-19T07:34:56.550183585Z","modified_time":"2024-11-19T07:06:04Z","sha256":"db8050330a14ea0cbafdbba285a6f38ad157a4477e866ffc82f60f96b83437d1","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/offline-rl-congestion-control","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.266888416Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"79b31c834c0a68838e9d940cd1571f4df23545846e9aa0868531295ac3f54fa3","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/offline-rl-congestion-control","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.452047627Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"1c144e79980c0e56341b733c970e59592e1f56df443f7d1b41668ca35ec4cc11","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/offline-rl-congestion-control","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.566301089Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"ba5c8eb9e302c564a0a3d2dd01fda523fde962250872fd67b4148b115e74b296","source":"kam193","versions":["99.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
