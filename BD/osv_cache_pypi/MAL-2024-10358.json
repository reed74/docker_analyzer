Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (4a45330983b6f8c082da4d9100ab2369efe9e0e1a362ed9582b1bf3c45c07ef4)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'lightseeq' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lightseeq","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/lightseeq"},"versions":["99.7","98.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/lightseeq/MAL-2024-10358.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/lightseeq"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-05T08:37:05.278821668Z","modified_time":"2024-11-05T08:15:44Z","sha256":"4a45330983b6f8c082da4d9100ab2369efe9e0e1a362ed9582b1bf3c45c07ef4","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/lightseeq","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.174441554Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"e05295fff675c660ece24dbc1322cf019c4a8d35b64230486b629ec234acef40","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/lightseeq","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.356455862Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"3d14d6932bfe1a879a7af0d37aa99c04a96678783d745e6587d5c95c39086e09","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/lightseeq","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.481396454Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"ae5dfb4422345258cf668c5752bb04b8bed89df7c4a17fa46225d51b48b32215","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7","98.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
