Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username.
