By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins. This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through and including 2.3.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"binwalk","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/binwalk"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.2b"},{"last_affected":"2.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/01/GHSA-3cm8-v4mc-gppg/GHSA-3cm8-v4mc-gppg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4510"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/12/msg00022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-07"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-01-31T20:53:49Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-01-26T21:18:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
