Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (bde59205ef4ee15d8744f0efe772084f90f8adaf50e577decd99d83a93e58af2)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'tarseir' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tarseir","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/tarseir"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/tarseir/MAL-2024-10462.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/tarseir"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:30.029077632Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:50Z","sha256":"bde59205ef4ee15d8744f0efe772084f90f8adaf50e577decd99d83a93e58af2","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/tarseir","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.433467728Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"37cbc995a19904b2470a5b1bd7d1d1c5aaf2e6ad829f895b591ffcab593a25b5","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/tarseir","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.617565484Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"fb4497700ac14b8516caa9617140ab894fba22e92b91a7812d576b581ab7cc85","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/tarseir","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.721737923Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"744bc819f2b9e322ac04a1b3444a0cb5106aa0686ea5668d4e8e1e37f2b30474","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
