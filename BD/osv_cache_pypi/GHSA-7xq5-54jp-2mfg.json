{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg","published":"2025-04-17T18:33:20Z","modified":"2025-04-23T15:02:32.271597Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-32377"],"summary":"Rasa Pro Missing Authentication For Voice Connector APIs","details":"## Vulnerability\nA vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro where voice connectors in Rasa Pro do not properly implement authentication even when a token is configured in the `credentials.yml` file. This could allow an attacker to submit voice data to the Rasa Pro assistant from an unauthenticated source.\n\nThis impacts the following connectors:\n\n- `audiocodes_stream`\n- `genesys`\n- `jambonz`\n\nAs part of our investigation to resolve this issue, we have also performed a security review of our other voice channel connectors:\n\n- `browser_audio`: Does not support authentication. This is a development channel not intended for production use.\n- `twilio_media_streams`, `twilio_voice` and `jambonz`: Authentication is currently not supported by these channels, but our investigation has found a way for us to enable it for these voice channel connectors in a future Rasa Pro release.\n\n## Fix\nThe issue has been resolved for `audiocodes`, `audiocodes_stream`, and `genesys` connectors. Fixed versions of Rasa Pro have been released for `3.9.20`, `3.10.19`, `3.11.7` and `3.12.6`. Please update to a fixed release.\n\nIf you are using one of the affected connectors, we strongly recommend upgrading to a fixed version. For connectors where authentication is not supported (e.g., Twilio), we suggest taking extra caution and considering other compensating controls if applicable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rasa-pro","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/rasa-pro"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.12.0"},{"fixed":"3.12.6"}]}],"versions":["3.12.0","3.12.1","3.12.1.dev1","3.12.1.dev2","3.12.2","3.12.2.dev2","3.12.2.dev3","3.12.2.dev4","3.12.3","3.12.4","3.12.5","3.12.6.dev1","3.12.6.dev2"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.12.5","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rasa-pro","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/rasa-pro"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.11.0"},{"fixed":"3.11.7"}]}],"versions":["3.11.0","3.11.1","3.11.2","3.11.3","3.11.3a1.dev1","3.11.3a1.dev2","3.11.3a1.dev4","3.11.3a1.dev5","3.11.3a1.dev6","3.11.3a1.dev7","3.11.4","3.11.5","3.11.6"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.11.6","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rasa-pro","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/rasa-pro"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.10.0"},{"fixed":"3.10.19"}]}],"versions":["3.10.10","3.10.11","3.10.12","3.10.13","3.10.13a1","3.10.14","3.10.15","3.10.16","3.10.17","3.10.18","3.10.3","3.10.4","3.10.5","3.10.6","3.10.7","3.10.7.dev1","3.10.7.dev2","3.10.7.dev3","3.10.7.dev4","3.10.7.dev5","3.10.8","3.10.9","3.10.9.dev1"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.10.18","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rasa-pro","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/rasa-pro"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.20"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.1.post1","3.8.16","3.8.17","3.8.18","3.9.14","3.9.15","3.9.16","3.9.17","3.9.18","3.9.19"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.9.17","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-pro-security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RasaHQ/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-7xq5-54jp-2mfg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32377"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-306"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-17T18:33:20Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-18T20:15:16Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
