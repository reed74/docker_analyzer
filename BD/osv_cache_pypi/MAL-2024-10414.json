Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (39d2b12a312238f2ab521998ef2c7ed0a25ecc4ef8b46a7991d27d2ca466ee81)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'dbt-byteshouse' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dbt-byteshouse","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/dbt-byteshouse"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/dbt-byteshouse/MAL-2024-10414.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/dbt-byteshouse"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-06T08:37:39.176188638Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T08:12:39Z","sha256":"39d2b12a312238f2ab521998ef2c7ed0a25ecc4ef8b46a7991d27d2ca466ee81","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dbt-byteshouse","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.978368061Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b24192da82e90cf77f5b7020b45123920f679143196846dbf569bfe37779b9b7","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dbt-byteshouse","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.171894856Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a28901c21fc8965eca406c72802ea54284404524f91641c843d1c95613eb59ad","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/dbt-byteshouse","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.311325207Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"04697896556a6e78274d4cfd1dc3f587a55e2d1b4ae3ef232b844f18f456a7c2","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
