Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (1f585e18c5231e86019bb574a705a7436461cbc4ffe0e39ad716bd32bc02b618)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'megai' @ 92.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"megai","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/megai"},"versions":["92.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/megai/MAL-2024-10593.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/megai"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T08:06:52.959125027Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T07:36:01Z","sha256":"1f585e18c5231e86019bb574a705a7436461cbc4ffe0e39ad716bd32bc02b618","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["92.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/megai","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.207098986Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"57c9af037c590af04d76482885dffd0b3063e1fbc692ceb0f73b16074b31f2bd","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/megai","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.389366097Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"cf55b7a21c0b518a8c8a38338e3e394473362ff6c54ebc25e0efb88213a4556c","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/megai","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.514020877Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"f6bd72193db3c6654d10107024c4e9ae4c703750644f0690c0c0fa16d5fee641","source":"kam193","versions":["92.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
