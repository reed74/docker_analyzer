Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (afb26fc4b8295305fcc947c5e11588856edeb80edce64add5070b67c827d38b9)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'jaqmc' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jaqmc","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/jaqmc"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/jaqmc/MAL-2024-10453.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/jaqmc"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:30.341359105Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:51Z","sha256":"afb26fc4b8295305fcc947c5e11588856edeb80edce64add5070b67c827d38b9","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/jaqmc","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.142454884Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"1d606df220b9e7b34d0367269f1de845568d4dcd0e4a66874e2be6f8098f10b9","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/jaqmc","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.325923195Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"76b75b81e33ae9df9b6383f48e916371a23f120cf492a567a8032352501c55de","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/jaqmc","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.457946216Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"49d25c51e848836a9871b2e8009b4083ac58dc4c40b475d6674331769ccaa5d4","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
