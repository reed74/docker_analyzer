Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (c235c19b294f6525db099362bcd84e2b942e0f9d54a448042f7f81e692cd4e14)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'shadowkw' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"shadowkw","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/shadowkw"},"versions":["912.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/shadowkw/MAL-2024-10460.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/shadowkw"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-07T04:06:29.816669614Z","modified_time":"2024-11-07T03:55:47Z","sha256":"c235c19b294f6525db099362bcd84e2b942e0f9d54a448042f7f81e692cd4e14","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["912.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/shadowkw","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.397626174Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"a792276a4e8085b0c066eb8c1be74ea8fd7be2138ef266b7d251bc7b9f86a4d2","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/shadowkw","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.583781091Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"9584e23e5cf96daa5974754d9ab0a8993263f290ee3006eebf247024fd1b34f8","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/shadowkw","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.686406129Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"f76c9be24e90553b21de5de6b2950b5c2d59a333a439f68baf1b7838003e86c3","source":"kam193","versions":["912.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
