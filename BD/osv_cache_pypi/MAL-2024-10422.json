Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (3c87a27dcd130cfef17d8390579d6584dad1ea166da2dfed348b5a0faa29102b)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'tktoken' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tktoken","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/tktoken"},"versions":["99.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/tktoken/MAL-2024-10422.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/tktoken"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-06T08:37:38.761838706Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T08:10:54Z","sha256":"3c87a27dcd130cfef17d8390579d6584dad1ea166da2dfed348b5a0faa29102b","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["99.7"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/tktoken","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.462118442Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"60d407f35a8c05fc0323e640cdbcfbb6163204d4f72693da7a2da917f07cb8ea","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/tktoken","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.64605795Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"00d11ef99393eeb8899b4ce0fdcfc051f28305fbbe851e064eb984b21bb7c42e","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/tktoken","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.746091553Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"da4191ed97c781241de6300c98049c00c53cd68eb44662180bd68384092083d0","source":"kam193","versions":["99.7"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
