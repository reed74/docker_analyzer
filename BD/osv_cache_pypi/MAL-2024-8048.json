Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest?

It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (50491db3bc2fec0a9994d5ababe016a6344ceab5d5005b49dcaf8f73c704ac9a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5' @ 0.2.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5"},"versions":["0.2.0","0.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5/MAL-2024-8048.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-27T18:06:10.418898366Z","modified_time":"2024-08-27T18:06:05Z","sha256":"50491db3bc2fec0a9994d5ababe016a6344ceab5d5005b49dcaf8f73c704ac9a","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.2.0"]},{"import_time":"2024-08-27T18:37:06.769797228Z","modified_time":"2024-08-27T18:36:54Z","sha256":"e4e0969cb6d9b89cc8b432e99f4d7f99fbf0e23efae6ca8ca72ec1d82daf3892","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.4.0"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.925937908Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"44872f47f4f8fb3713260826d39c8ff156ee9552118c093f02eda175a0e5dd56","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.966073466Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"ffd940df08afab8ca93f472de627c4cc633b5de2d3331b58a84602a882390ac1","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-76a351f5","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.270493239Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"55007ff016365164c608823b54b404c175ea904fe83e6845c9c34175f723b49b","source":"kam193","versions":["0.2.0","0.4.0"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
