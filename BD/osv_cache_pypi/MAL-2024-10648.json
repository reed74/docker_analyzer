Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9f148c28049cc284705c6779108306c3926c7144edca1a957fe7d78e613d22ef)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'kera-preprocessing' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kera-preprocessing","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/kera-preprocessing"},"versions":["94.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/kera-preprocessing/MAL-2024-10648.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/kera-preprocessing"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-13T09:05:39.479449481Z","modified_time":"2024-11-13T09:00:45Z","sha256":"9f148c28049cc284705c6779108306c3926c7144edca1a957fe7d78e613d22ef","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["94.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/kera-preprocessing","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.147147534Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"df97e9119c5b1c5bea82ee4e674ff10c5323dc84ca4af0766360dd08a49383fe","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/kera-preprocessing","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.330620869Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"973d4eb03e9256234b20a9fd346a83f5ddced04587ffbf9a7b9762fbe15a1231","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/kera-preprocessing","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.462687896Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"5baa723ed613beb519ce822785121b088a5bd529cefc83c5b66082102fb01569","source":"kam193","versions":["94.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
