Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (a0331fd3bfa882f999cde2b7d900dc238fd60bd0e5d877a6994e27c55cebe7d1)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'type-extension' @ 95.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"type-extension","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/type-extension"},"versions":["95.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/type-extension/MAL-2024-10732.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/type-extension"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-15T09:35:13.217680243Z","modified_time":"2024-11-15T09:13:13Z","sha256":"a0331fd3bfa882f999cde2b7d900dc238fd60bd0e5d877a6994e27c55cebe7d1","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["95.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/type-extension","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.479353409Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"b4dd1e0b78306779944226f9836bf41b41260bfff8dad1a86717297b61d13ebf","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/type-extension","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.659335257Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"3d68be7ebeb4e06c6e29be15274785ff085ea469d680f831c9d40a4dc3b54e8c","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/type-extension","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:58.756045555Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","sha256":"4cd038cf4b74ad9a9f13cde77a1086068a0c074f43b20b5ec03646ddd284746f","source":"kam193","versions":["95.6"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
