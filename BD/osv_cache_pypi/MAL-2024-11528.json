It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc"},"versions":["0.2.5","0.3.0","0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc/MAL-2024-11528.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2024-10972","import_time":"2024-12-09T14:38:40.792907105Z","modified_time":"2024-12-09T06:49:47Z","sha256":"05c0e8de9ed50d77cf6d17c034ca116b86465c00d513c6561f893480da95cdff","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["0.2.5","0.3.0"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.939332802Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"ef5765aa95f24c87a09f27b8a2e0e67b20af57ab7ceeea5f2f6279f79bd9fb07","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:17.978566781Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"8c38a10b7ad9b95b75ed342f766c42e203bbccd220031288c7107dac87641451","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f9dafccc","import_time":"2025-12-10T21:38:57.283920157Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","sha256":"bde09c82e0c469f34cb5da0345449db0a0bd3dedeaaf2643475a2e406ec3cb3b","source":"kam193","versions":["0.3.0","0.2.0","0.2.5"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
